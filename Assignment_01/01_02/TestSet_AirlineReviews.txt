Hong Kong to London via Beijing. Worst airline I have ever tried, from their online services to the flight quality. Their website is a joke, it keeps timing out and it doesn't allow you to checkin for flights that have intermediate stops. I have complained to one of their staff at the airport and they admitted that they have issues with their online check-in. The plane was also a joke, especially the one used to fly from Beijing to London. I'm 188cm tall, I didn't have enough legroom and my knee were pushed against the sit in front of me for 11 hours! The legroom was less than in a cheap low cost airline (e.g. Ryanair), how can that happen in an international flight where you need to be sit for more than ten hours! Let's ignore the cleanliness and comfort, but a minimum amount of legroom should always be provided. The flight entertainment was also embarrassing, straight out of the nineties, the resolution of the display was probably the same as one of the first smartphone ever produced, it was painful to watch, and the controllers of the entertainment system were unintuitive and most of the buttons to press were unresponsive. The meal quality was really poor, food was just a little warm, they gave us two options for the meals and they ran out of the first option immediately, I think they managed to serve maybe ten persons and then they ran out of it, speechless! To conclude our trip properly they damaged one of our luggage, we found the luggage completely open running around on the belt at the luggage collection, we obviously filled in an official complaint as part of the content was broken/lost. I think, no matter how cheap their flights are, we will never book a flight with them, worst experience ever!	0
Inhumane seats. I fly constantly, maybe 50 flights a year. These are the worst seats I've ever "fit" in. I weigh about 210 and am 5' 11". I have shortish legs for my height. Still I can point my knees forward as they press into the seat in front of me. Every move the person makes in front of me, I feel. Now. I flew on points. So even with my Air Canada status they shoved me to the back of the plane (with my wife). They should be ashamed. My wife actually felt claustrophobic. Air Canada. Anything for a buck.	0
Our flight was late arriving in Ho Chi Min for our flight to Moscow with no apology from the crew. They let passengers onto the flight who had been drinking heavily and nothing was said or done to turn them away the crew were unhelpful and sullen the food was inedible. On arriving in Moscow we thought we still had time to catch our next flight to London Heathrow only to be told the flight had already left. When we arrived at the desk we were given tickets for the next day and told we would be in a Hotel for the night. No apologies there was a lot of shrugging of shoulders and being told to sit over there. Rude and very unhelpful.	0
Miami to Mexico City was a very bad experience. A 3 hr flight became a 9 hr flight because they make us stop in another airport - for almost 4 hours. There we sat inside the plane, they didn't let us get down for a meal, drink etc. arguing it was an international flight. A bad, very bad experience.	0
Ho Chi Minh City to Newark via Beijing. The absolute worst airline I have ever flown with. For starters they boarded us at 10:30am and we did not leave until after 2pm. They gave us no reason why, the weather was perfect and there were all types of rumors flying to where they could not get approval for us to fly over Russia. The staff is extremely rude, unpleasant and speaks next to no English not even understanding basic questions about food and drinks. At one point the staff told me and my neighbor sitting next to me we had to be quiet. Mind you we were talking quiet and politely. A couple hours later a couple of Chinese women were rudely talking basically where anyone and everyone could hear, but of course the staff said nothing to them. The food is disgusting and the only snack they offer is card board bread with a slice of fake ham. Then when I finally arrive at my destination they announce my name and then tell me my luggage was left in Ho Chi Minh city and it would be delivered to me 2 days later. Finally 2 and a half days later I get my luggage and the lock is missing and you can tell my luggage has been opened. I will never fly with this disgraceful airline again and I advise you too avoid them at all costs. I almost forgot to mention my tv monitor did not work, but it did not matter 95% of the movies were all Chinese flicks.	0
Los Angeles to Tokyo via Beijing. Recently, I had a delayed flight and it turned out to be the worst flight experience I've ever had. First of all, hardly any of the staff can speak English. The ones that can speak very minimal English. They are not helpful at all and it seems like they don't know what they are doing. At times it seems like they are more confused than the passengers. When we had to get new boarding passes, the staff seemed very frustrated. There were 3 lines and I unfortunately stood in the line that had an employee who was trying to help the other two lines. He ended up attending to our line about half the time. Eventually, one of the the staff left and he ended up following her. They were never seen again and no one told us what was going on. Air China gave us a free night at a hotel since there were no flights available that night. It was a pretty bad hotel experience. The free stay would be nice if you came with another person, but as a solo person, you had to either share a room with a complete stranger or pay $100 for a single room. Ridiculous! When trying to reserve a room, the staff seemed very rude. They would say, "Wait a moment." They wouldn't specify how long I had to wait. When I asked them a third time, the guy appeared to make a number up just to shut me up. I saw another staff behind the counter playing a game on his phone. Customer service is non-existent in this company. They are fine when there are no problems, but when their are difficulties, they really need to manage the situation better. I'd say 75-90% of the passengers were confused based on what they told me and their reactions.	0
Toronto to Punta Cana with Air Canada rouge. Horrible. The worst flight of my life in every possible way. Rude attendants. Many frustrated and cheap passengers. No respect. No courtesy. Everyone angry. I have a 3 year old who was given a separate seat and daddy and I were a long way from her. I finally found a vacant seat nearby so I could be relatively close. they didn't even let me hold her to calm her down during take off and landing. Will never fly this airline. It's a pity that it's dragging down the Air Canada name with it too. It makes me mad even thinking about those 2 flights. No entertainment for kids just pure torture for everyone.	0
On October 8th 2022, we were suppose to fly with Air Canada from Jakarta to Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific then contacting flight from Hong Kong to Vancouver with Air Canada. When we went to check-in counter at Jakarta we were informed by Cathay that Air Canada has changed out flight we will have to wait more then 24 hours at Hong Kong Airport in order to fly back home and in Hong Kong they will put us in quarantine for 3 days. Cathay tried for 3 hours to contact Air Canada but they never respond there call, finally after waiting for 3 hours at Jakarta, Cathay changed our flight for next day so that we don't have to wait for 24 hour and we can still fly out of Hong Kong with our original flight Air Canada on 9th October. The next day again we went back to Jakarta Airport to fly with Cathay Pacific to Hong Kong then with contacting flight with Air Canada again we found out that Air Canada has cancelled our reservation. We ended up to buy another 2 tickets from Jakarta to Vancouver for $1400 dollars. Never again fly with Air Canada incompetent airline which is the worst.	0
After multiple delays, flight adjustments and additional stop overs being added to my flight, my luggage is now missing. Air Canada help desk can not provide any updates and just tell you to wait! I have to move onto my next destination with no luggage and no direction on support! I will never fly this airline again!	0
Already 4 hours late. But we got a complementary water. Multiple switching connections that keeps changing. Will see if we ever get to take off. 1/10, would not fly again.	0
Puerto Vallarta to Costa Rica via Mexico City. I am not sure if it truly worth to write this Aeromexico review keeping in mind that the average rating is already at 2 stars and Management apparently don't care if passengers are happy for as long as Bonus Payments are great! I truly hope that the shape of the inside of the cabin is no indication of aircraft maintenance, because inside was horrible! Broken and dirty seats and WC, the service provided was anything but great, one could say that the crew did not like to take early flights. The food was of the lowest possible quality standard. I wish  there would be more competition out there.	0
London Heathrow to Cork. What a disappointment! After travelling half way around the world, being exposed to some super airport and inflight service, to finish our journey on our own countries carrier Aer Lingus, should have been great, how wrong we were. Staff at the check in desk chewing gum and dressed scruffy set the tone, very poor. Called to check in and then made stand for 40 minutes just past the check in desk?  Why check in passengers and make them stand in a small area, when the plane hasn't disembarked it's previous passengers? This shows a total lack of regard for the elderly, people not in full health and people completing long journeys. After 40 minutes of standing we went back past the check in area to the seats so the kids could sit comfortably and complained to Aer Lingus staff, not that they seemed to care as they were to interested in chatting amongst themselves. And why does it take 6 staff to check in a small plane?  Unfortunately things on the plane weren't much better, poorly dressed staff looking tired and rough, we couldn't understand the lady on the mic reading the safety statement, neither could the girl demonstrating this as they were in and out of sync, lack of professional refreshment service provided as the first thing they were asked for off the menu seemed to confuse the stewardess and she dissappeared for a while and returned with a no we don't have that. It was only a sandwich that was requested by another passenger. Obviously there are good staff with Aer Lingus also, but this is spoilt by a poor few and bad practices. I would recommend management in Aer Lingus should get on a Singapore Airlines flight to see how it should be done, very well dressed staff throughout a long flight, very attentive and polite to any need or request, each one of them asked the name of our kids and used it when talking to them (Aer Lingus staff didn't bother to ask, the chewing gum was obviously in the way), very well organised at check in time even though dealing with a great deal more passengers and it didn't take six of them to do it either! Come on Aer Lingus staff you can do much better than this, and it wouldn't take much, just a better regard for your customers and some manners.	0
Air Berlin from Dortmund to Barcelona via Palma. Plane was late arriving in Dortmund and more delayed leaving for Palma. Our AB connection did not wait in Palma so we were re booked onto another flight. Crew unfriendly and did not care that many passengers missed their flights. Our flights from check-in in Dortmund to Barcelona took 9 hrs 45 mins. Air Berlin used to be very good now they are people carriers who simply do not care.	0
Bangkok to London via Beijing. I've never written a review before but I'm so appalled by Air China's service that I need to warn others. My flight from Bangkok to Beijing was delayed due to snow in Beijing which meant that I missed my connecting flight from China to London. I wasn't mad at this as bad weather conditions can't be helped but the staff at Air China were unhelpful beyond belief, weren't accommodating or understanding at all and didn't even have the customer service to even apologise for the inconvenience! 10 stranded Brits were appalled by the way Air China handed the inconvenience and that all Air China did was put us on the same flight the next day and barked at us that they would arrange a hotel for us. To make things worse not only could Air China then not retrieve our luggage which we asked for after we waited for it for over 2 hours telling us rudely to just "wait more". It took them a total of 4 hours from when we landed, to take and just leave us at a hotel without even translating what had happened to the hotel staff. We all then were left to argue against the hotel staff about an agreement that they had in place with Air China which was that it was two people to a double room regardless of who, and if we wanted a single room to ourselves we had to pay, which meant that we had to stay in a room with complete strangers! Absolutely ridiculous and unsafe! The hotel staff were equally not accommodating or understanding, we were provided with food but were only allowed one bottle of water per person for the night. The next day, we asked Air China if anything could be done for the massive inconvenience and just got a rude "no". I'm disgusted at the way Air China operate and their rude staff and couldn't believe that they treated us like the inconvenience was our fault. It was so stressful and looking back to the events, it's unbelievable how we've been treated. When I asked to speak to the manager about how long we had to wait for our transport to our hotel, he just barked at me in limited English telling me to just "wait, it will be soon". It's disgusting customer service and attitude, I urge people to not use them as it is not worth saving a bit of money to be treated in this way and ruining your holiday.	0
Disgraceful airline and an absolute shame to Canadian standards. I had a simple 1.5 hour direct journey from Boston to Toronto. This unfolded into a nightmare that lasted about 12 hours. Two of my flights from Boston to Toronto in the morning were cancelled, thus missed my connection at noon with another airline! Rebooked flight was from Boston to Montreal to Toronto of which both flights were delayed by over 1.5 hours.  If you are looking for punctual and good service, look elsewhere please!	0
Before boarding, the terrible customer service people at the gate made people check their bags even though there was an excessive amount of space in overhead compartments. With their terrible rate of baggage loss, this has ruined my flight and others.	0
We flew Air Canada from Cairo, Egypt on a 787 Dreamliner to Montreal. Business class. Nice flight terrible food. We got to Montreal late but our connecting flight was also delayed. No flight crew. We were finally boarded for the short flight to Chicago. We waited on the plane for another hour. Air Canada cancelled the flight due to mechanical issues. We then had to wait hours in line to get hotel taxi and food arrangements. It was after midnight before we got to our hotel then up again at 4.30 am to get back to the airport to catch the flight to Chicago then another flight to St Louis. I was told I would be reimbursed for a Chicago hotel room I had already booked and paid for and was too late to cancel. Well today I was informed no reimbursement because unscheduled mechanical issues. Needless to say I will never fly Air Canada again and neither should you.	0
Flight 472 November 19th, Mexico City to Houston. A 5 hrs delay because of fog and poorly managed. No organised procedure for passengers, no water, no terminal, no attention, no information. And the worst, the ground staff were very rude. We feel treated like cattle. Finally they took us into a bus to reach the plane and the crew had to be replaced. So they took us back to the waiting room. Again they took us to the plane by a bus and after 5 hours delay, we were able to fly.	0
We, a family of 5 including 2 children and an infant, was supposed to fly from Toronto to Kochi via Dublin. Toronto to Dublin leg was to be on Aer Lingus. When we reached the Airport to Check in, the agent said that we could not fly, because the flight was cancelled and asked us to call their booking agent to rebook our tickets. Their agent, after hours of waiting, said that she has booked us on Emirates for the next day. So we went home. Then when we checked the Emirates site, there was no such booking. We called up Emirates and they said that, Aer Lingus had only made a reservation but had not ticketed it, so it got cancelled automatically. So we tried calling Aer Lingus again and after hours of being on hold, Aer Lingus finally said that we were booked on Air Canada for Jan 8th. So we went to the Airport and at the check in counter, the agent said that she could not find a ticket for our baby. So Aer Lingus, when re-issuing our ticket had re-issued only 4 tickets instead of 5 and had missed out on our infant. So we called them again to try to fly on the next flight, but they said that they could not do anything. Then we again went home at 10.30pm with the 3 children and all the luggage. The whole night we kept trying to call Aer Lingus and finally in the morning, they said that we had to buy a fully fresh ticket for our baby and that they would reimburse it. So we went to our agent to buy the ticket and somehow they fixed our infant's ticket for us. But later while returning, when we checked with Etihad, our original carrier, they said that Aer Lingus would not have been able to reimburse the ticket fare, since it is not their ticket that we are buying - and it is Air Canada's ticket. So even that was cheating from the side of Aer Lingus. So my personal advice to anyone out there is to never trust or travel on Aer Lingus.	0
CPH-DUS one way. A very bad experience. Check in was a mess ticket incredibly expensive for what they offer. Excess baggage 10 euro per kilo. On board you have to pay for everything and very expensive. Plane was old and not very clean. Legroom was a nightmare and seats uncomfortable. And the most important: crew very rude and not smiling.	0
Newark to Ho Chi Minh City via Beijing, and Air China are the worst airline ever. Do not know how they are in business. One month before my international trip they canceled my return flight for reason "irregular operations" and gave me no reasonable alternatives for rebooking (3 days ahead or like 4 days after the initial date - and no hotel or compensation offered for the inconvenience). There were available flights that day but they refused to rebook me on different flights if i didn't pay extra, given the prices are now so expensive a month ahead. So essentially they canceled my trip last moment. I had to take the refund and get new tickets which were now twice the price. Also their wait times to get in touch with customer service are about 1 hour - ridiculous to the extreme.	0
Phoenix to Calgary. Worst airline ever. Every few years I decide to try them again. How could they mess up this time?. Well silly me. I booked a return flight. Then my client who I was traveling to see moved the meeting so I needed to change the inbound flight. Airline said no changes allowed. I was happy buying a new inbound ticket but they said if I didn't show up for inbound flight, the entire ticket would be cancelled.	0
I had only been to Canada once before to Montreal by bus- when I was young and poor - that was a considerably better experience than Air Canada- that is disorganized filled with ambiguous phrase or non-articulated conditions on charging and delays and shamelessly indifferent to customer comfort. I think the Canadian government should look into this company. From a distance I have always had the absolute greatest respect for Canadian culture — this airline is a liability - it has utterly changed my sense of this nation and culture I will certainly never again fly Air Canada - will never come to Toronto again - and will as widely as I can - disperse the information of Air Canada's unrestrained jerking around of its customers — my flight itinerary has been as simple as can be — Toronto NYC - a simple hour and some minutes flight on a Sunday — my flight at 6 am was cancelled - I was on the phone for three hours, three hours wrangling with customer service who seemed to have no authority on what they were doing who were claiming I had to pay to be placed on another flight pay extra in addition to my flight - even though Air Canada had cancelled! What kind of a scam is that? Complete incentive for the airline to cancel on people left and right — Later in the airport an agent informed me that my basic ticket purchase has no “protection” against airline cancellations — completely unregulated unprincipled gouging — I was placed on a flight with a 2:30 departure - that again was cancelled - no COVID congestions no serious weather advisories in Toronto —it is a sunny day —yes the weather is not good in New York but the airport delays are by 15 minutes nothing more serious — over a simple hour flight I have been delayed by 14 hours with the prospect earlier had I not vehemently defended myself of paying for this privilege — REPUGNANT -	0
Delhi to Washington via Beijing. My flight was first delayed by more than 12 hours and I was made to miss my connecting flight from Beijing. I was still asked to board this flight from Delhi by Air China staff even though they knew that they won't be able to provide me connecting flight. So they lied to me. After reaching China the rude staff again told me that we don't know which your next flight will be, and I have to go and talk to the ticket office in the morning, and it was 11.30 in night. I was sent to a hotel where the staff was very rude and denied to help or cooperate. Once somehow after managing to reach to the airport in the morning (I had no China money) I had to run around the ticket office so I can find the flight for US. I was left stranded in another country just like that with no further information.  After fighting at ticket office for long time, I was given next flight for 8 hours later, and I had to spend entire day on Beijing airport and my luggage was also not transferred to the next flight. I had to stand 3 hours in front of lost and found to pick my luggage for next check in. And their staff didn't speak English.	0
Bangkok to Munich via Beijing with Air China. The absolute worst airline company ever.  Service on board is ok, but customer service is a complete nightmare - they are impossible to reach and let you get stranded on an airport in the middle of the night with -5 degrees without any communication. Connecting flights are off like 70% of the time, so be prepared.	0
Edmonton to Chicago via Toronto. Edmonton to Chicago. I had a worst case experience with the staff and their services. I asked one of the air hostess for a cup of water as I was feeling very thirsty. Then they replied me that we are going to land so that’s why I can’t offer anything with very rudely. It was like 30-mins to more to go to land the flight. I would never recommend to anyone to go by this airlines.	0
Terrible experience on 10.5 hours flight from Toronto to Tel Aviv. Old and uncomfortable fabric seats little leg space for this class, seat trays and video monitors were difficult to open and retract, not enough blankets, families with infants and toddlers upgraded to premium. An unfriendly flight attendant who did not want to be bothered and got annoyed when my wife was not sure what to order. First and last time on Air Canada. Never again.	0
Never got a chance to fly with them on planned Boston to Vienna via Dublin trip. I had a family emergency, booked through American Express and when I asked for a voucher, credit, refund or even a portion they told me I needed to pick a date right away for when I want to go to Europe - obviously wasn't able to do that fast. Its a big trip. Ended up with nothing and wasted $865. No call, no email or anything. I won't be flying with them ever.	0
DUS-PUJ-DUS. The on time schedule was ok but I have never experienced such an unfriendly and unprofessional cabin crew with really poor language skills! Aas I was about to change the position of overhead luggage to get the lighter one in the less strong compartment I was told to remove it immediately. Even after explanation the answer was she would not care as this compartment was not for me. When requesting a new blanket as the one on our seats were obviously already used the same person told us that this was not her job the cleaners should have fixed this but if we want new ones we should get up and look for it ourselves.	0
San Francisco to Yangon via Beijing. Very bad customer service. My wife and I flew business class from San Francisco to Yangon via Beijing. We arrived at Yangon minus all 3 pieces of our checked in luggage. All Air China rep will say is to wait for 2 days for the next flight to Yangon to get our luggage. We have to attend a wedding and would like our get our luggage sooner, perhaps Air China can send it via Thai the next day. But no one cares about doing anything other than tell us rudely to wait for 2 days. No attempt is made by Air China to reimburse for the expense of getting clothes and toiletries for the two days. All phone calls to any Air China office went unanswered. They act like typical government employees: no attempt is made to satisfy customers. They seem to think that it is a privilege to fly their airlines. I will never fly Air China again and I urge others to not just consider cost. The service is terrible. And I haven't even talked about onboard service. The flight attendants asked me to open the table for my wife, then would hand me the tray for my wife instead of putting it on her table themselves.	0
Our experience with Air Canada Rouge was awful. In fairness, I should have done more research before buying the tickets. Our experience was Toronto to Dublin return. We flew from Toronto to Dublin on a red-eye flight, I can't comment on the experience too much as we were all asleep. The way back though was a nightmare. I was traveling by myself with our 2 year old daughter, and found out our plane from Dublin to Toronto was delayed by 2 hours when we got to the airport.  I started to get worried though as we had a connecting flight in Toronto, and though the layover was 2.5 hours, 2 hours delay is starting to cut things close. After occupying ourselves for 5 hours at the airport (which was actually an amazing airport) we went to get on the plane to look forward to 7 hours of flying. As we boarded there was somebody on the flight not feeling well, and the plane (and everyone on board and with connecting flights) then waited for 30 more minutes to see if they were going to get better. So 2.5 hours late, 5.5 hours since getting to the airport, we take off. The staff were awful, no friendly service or smiles, and when I asked about what was going to happen to people with connecting flights, the attendant told me "You'll have to ask once you get to the airport"! Even further, there were no apologies by the flight staff or pilots the whole flight about the delay, and almost everyone on board missed their connecting flights.  The service was the exact opposite of what customer service is. Needless to say, we missed our connecting flight, but we were the lucky ones. You have to download the Air Canada app to get any entertainment before you board, so 7 hours without any entertainment is more than you should ask of anyone. The only consolation was the food was pretty good and tasty.	0
Prague to Toronto. Violin Cruise Line booked my sister and me on Air Canada from Prague to Toronto. Little did I know that the flight was on Air Canada rouge that doesn't have movies/headphone jacks and expects one to know that one must fly with their own IPad and headphones plus download the Air Canada app prior to takeoff. They mention downloading the app but I did not realise it is mandatory to do so to be able to watch movies on one's cell phone or IPad until one is in the air and it is too late! (Unless you wish to rent their IPad). It was nearly 9 hours in a seat that did not recline with discount beverages and lousy meals.	0
Worst airline in North America. Rude staff, late, expensive, low quality rather zero customer politeness. Not on time, staff think they are carrying prisoners rather customers. I have been flying for last 25 years. Always same story. Wanted different airlines but due to family emergency this was only option available. Never again. You pay 5 star price and 2 star service.	0
The flight duration was 9 hrs & 15 min. There were only two food/drink services throughout the entire flight. They did not even offer water. You had to call the flight attendants to get water and you could not even buy drinks on the flight. The service on Air Canada is consistently terrible. If they had some meaningful competition, things would have been completely different, in my opinion. To be fair, the in-flight entertainment was good.	0
After my travel agent booked my flight, I found out, on the ticket, that I had to pay an extra $75 per suitcase. On my way to Manchester, the plane was late. I was told that the preferred seating (leg room) which I had paid $162 for, one way, was no longer available. After several attempts, the person in charge finally got me a legroom seat after all. On my way back from Manchester to Toronto I got to the airport at about 830 am for a 1230 pm take off and was told the flight was cancelled. We were put up for the night, meals included, in a mediocre hotel. Food was also mediocre. After boarding the plane next day I was told once again that the leg room seat I had paid $149 for was not available. As the plane was not full, the stewardess noted a legroom seat that was unoccupied and said, "you'd better grab that one, but if someone else claims it, you'll have to move." I paid a total of $311 extra, on top of my flight for legroom seating and was eventually granted these seats as if it was a favour. Another steward told me to put my mask on as I was taking it off to eat. They were bringing the meals at the time. I ignored her so I could eat. After that she ignored me, not once, but twice, when the drinks trolley was brought along. I had to go after her to request an orange juice. The second time, I had to ask a different stewardess for a cup of tea because madam seemed determined not to serve me, and once again cruised past me, refusing to make eye contact, while I called out to her. Her behaviour was appalling. No one can eat with a mask on, and food and drink service was included in the price of my ticket. Overall, my first experience with Air Canada was not good. And I thought Air Transat was bad.	0
Flying home from Zurich to Toronto the Boeing 787 seating was torture.  It was so tight it was a task to get up to use the washrooms. That plane with it's seating arrangement is totally unsuitable to use for a 9 hr overseas flight. From Toronto to Halifax, on an A320. Plane was lovely, we boarded and then waited for an hour for a piece of cargo. Of course late getting home.	0
Gatwick to San Francisco via Dublin and Aer Lingus are the worst airline I've flown. From a shoddy website and customer contact numbers pre-flight (no way to check in) to having a bassinet seat for our baby on the plane, which once in place meant we couldn't get in or out of the seats or access our tray tables or TV. Food on the flight that could only be described as disgusting and a non existent drinks service (on a 11 hour flight!). Rude check in staff at London Gatwick and to top it all off, losing all the luggage from passengers connecting through Dublin back to London Gatwick (and apparently the Manchester flight too) from SFO. The lost baggage took over 2 hours in the airport to sort out (took an hour to find someone to help us). We were never contacted with reference numbers to track our baggage and the Aer Lingus duty manager at Gatwick was rude with no clear explanations of what was happening or what the process was to get our baggage back. We are still waiting for information as to when our luggage will be reunited to us.	0
Melbourne to Shanghai. Sadly I have had to fly with this useless mob some number of times. Hoping the first time with Air China was just bad luck they have proven themselves again and again to be hopeless. Staff are rude and uncaring. They load 6 cans of beer for the flight so run out before reaching mid aircraft for service. No white wine - what makes them think every one drinks red? God forbid asking for a refreshment after trolley service - no chance of that. They have to always carry a security guard - wonder why - irate travellers who paid for service but don't get it that's why! Few English movies and bad seats makes it a long long flight.	0
Flew Toronto to Dublin with Air Canada rouge. Narrow cramped seats, very close to the one in front. No air controls above, no entertainment unless you rented an iPad. Food ok and cabin crew were young and inexperienced but tried hard. We will never ever again step onto a rouge flight. Most uncomfortable flight we have ever experienced.	0
Without question this is the worst long haul flight I have ever taken. I couldn’t believe that for 11 hours we were confined to the limited legroom of a 737. Was the 737 designed for long haul? The first leg of the overnight flight, from Vancouver to Halifax, didn’t serve a meal, but put out the lights and expected us to sleep. During the night we were hungry and thirsty, and had to go to the galley and ask for refreshments. Thank goodness we managed to buy a decent breakfast at Halifax Airport! Then back onto another 737 for the second leg of the flight. The meal offered was small and fairly tasteless (I think the worst I have ever experienced on long haul), and again the need to visit the galley to stay hydrated. The overhead lockers were absolutely jam packed by the time we got seated, and I ended up putting my rucksack under the seat, eating into my already limited legroom. It’s almost impossible to compare Air Canada with other carriers which I use for long haul e.g. BA, Thai, Malaysian, Cathay, Emirates, where the passenger is kept fed and hydrated by attentive staff. When I arrived at Heathrow I took two flights to reach home in northern Scotland- with BA and Loganair. Each flight was less than an hour and had I more room and comfort than crossing the Atlantic!	0
After only 3 delays and rerouted tickets, I was only 11hrs late. Then they canceled my wife's return ticket without notice, and I was forced to buy a brand new ticket to get home in time! So wonderful, truly a memorable flight experience. They offered me a “discounted” direct flight home for only double the cost of my original round trip ticket, what an amazing deal. When I showed them the same flight on their website for half that price they were completely confused. Ended up purchasing that ticket, because it was cheaper than the “solution” they were offering for the problem they created. 0/10. Zero stars. Looking forward to this companies inevitable restructuring and name change so they can go about offering terrible service under a different moniker soon.	0
If you don't want to lose your mind with delayed and canceled flights I would avoid this airline. Our pilot was funny and informative, but the staff was rude and very unprofessional. The Air Canada app is another sore point. If you can get it to work, it kicks you out and makes you verify everything again. Will never fly with this airline again.	0
Delhi-Barcelona. I could not check-in online so called up the airlines to find my flight was re-scheduled. My connecting flight had been rescheduled so that my transit took 24 hrs and they wouldn't provide any sort of accommodation. Moscow airport contains narrow corridors with duty free shops food must be paid with Russian money. There was free Internet but only in a few places with low wifi signal. Plane food was bland and mediocre. Average service.	0
Chicago to México city with Aeromexico was the worst experience in my life. Don't know where to start. The staff at check point, including managers or the people at customer service from the phone. Nobody knows how to help you or solve a problem from their system to start off. They only want you to pay outrageous fees for no reason, and they just keep pointing fingers at other people. I personally, would never again use this airline, nor recommend it.	0
Bangkok to Montreal via Beijing. You get what you pay for. This was my first time and last time flying Air China. I'm wondering how they could pass Star Alliance basic standards. First, my flight was cancelled and I had to fly one day later. Their ticket office offered me a refund or change the booking to the next day. Having no choice to come back home, I had to take the flight the day after. Regarding the check-in, I had issues on both legs. From Bangkok, the check-in is done by Thai Airways staff but they were useless. I arrived 2 hours before at the airport and almost missed my flight because they could not fix the issue. I was traveling with my wife, an infant and a child. I had requested a baby bassinet which was only done on one leg. They had the great idea to put my wife and the infant on the first row and me and my child on a different row at the back of the plane. They couldn't give us seats all together so me and my wife could take care of our baby together. I even talked to the Station Manager in Beijing on the phone but she could not care less. On the way back, it was even more ridiculous. The check-in staff was very rude. The flight was full so they upgraded my wife to premium economy but me, my infant and child in Economy. Despite asking them to downgrade my wife so we could all seat together, they refused. They said they were unable to downgrade my wife nor upgrade the rest of my family so we could all seat together. What kind of airlines would separate a family on long-haul? This happened on both legs, so I assume this happened often. During the flight, the entertainment system was mostly for Chinese as there were very few English movies. As for the food, I would advice anyone to bring some snacks on board. There were only selection of Chinese food which was simply disgusting. It was so bad that I couldn't tell what kind of meat it was. My wife and I took different dishes to spread the risk, and all of them were very bad. Last but not least, when we came back home, we had one luggage missing. I took them 4 days to bring it back and my suitcase is really damaged so I can't use it anymore. My only positive point, which I was very surprised considering their ground staff, is that the crew were very nice and friendly.	0
I recently traveled from Washington to Bangkok via Beijing on Air China. My travels started out on 8th December 2016 and as of today I have yet to receive my checked luggage nor be compensated for the loss. I filed a Property Irregularity Report as soon as I landed in BKK and my checked bag was not with the rest of the people's checked bags that I flew with. They said if or when it arrived they would bring it to my hotel. It never did. My hotels were even nice enough to follow up with it everyday multiple times a day on the trip. I ended up having to buy clothes, borrow clothes, and purchase other items I had previously packed. It was the worst experience I have ever had with an airline. When the trip ended and I arrived back at BKK I let the gate agent there know the situation and she turned it over to another person, this person made some phone calls and told me I should speak to those in DC. SO I flew back to D.C. and when I got there I spoke to their baggage claim that worked for the airline. She informed me they have 21 days from the date I file the report to find my luggage (I filed it on the 10th December). Once the 21 days past if it is not found I am to file a report for compensation and it should take 2 months for them to compensate me. On 30 December 2016 I called the baggage claim office in IAD and spoke to an agent who acted completely incompetent when I started speaking to her about the issue. I told her the 21 days past so I am now seeking compensation for my lost luggage. She basically said they would keep looking for it and I asked how long do they have to look for it? An infinite amount of time? What is standard procedure? She then copied a bunch of people on an email (all of which had Gmail email address which I find absurd for a company this size and also extremely fishy) and turned it over to BKK and Beijing to handle my claim. I received a reply from one of the individuals she copied on the email in Chinese. I don't understand what about our previous correspondence indicated I speak Chinese. I had a friend translate it and he said the email was extremely unprofessional, it does not give a timeline of action or state a standard procedure. Everyone I have dealt with in this airline has either acted incompetent or unprofessional and I have lost a good amount of my belongings. I can't even get a standard procedure, a timeline of next steps, or an email in English. I will absolutely never fly on this unprofessional and incompetent airline again.	0
Air Canada rouge has got to be the worst airline that we have flown. We flew from Vancouver to Honolulu on a B767 aircraft. It was a very old airplane and a very dirty one too. Such neglect is simply unacceptable in the 21st century. A very bad image for the mother company indeed. I understand that it is a cheaper airline but still they have to do something about cleanliness. Nevertheless, I have to say that cabin crew was very polite and professional.	0
London Gatwick to Toronto with Air Canada rouge during August 2016. This was a very poor flight. There many faults. First, there was no inflight entertainment at all. We were told that there was inflight WiFi but this did not work. Very disappointing on such a long flight. The food was also poor and the announcements on the tannoy system were frequently inaudible. But by far, the worst aspect of the flight was the very limited legroom available. I am over 6' tall, and I struggled to find a comfortable position throughout this flight. On a long 8 hour flight I would have expected more room. I have flown many times with other carriers and have had adequate leg room on longer flights. I have also sometimes flown on short European low cost airline carriers with more legroom than this, and they are much cheaper carriers. What is surprising is that we flew a much shorter connecting flight (just over 4 hours) from Toronto to Victoria BC with Air Canada and had all the facilities that I described above. So why did Air Canada rouge not provide a better service for the much longer leg of the journey? I don't like to sound so negative and would not give negative feedback easily but this carrier were very poor value for money.	0
Flew from Toronto to San Francisco, Air Canada was making all passengers place their roller bag and personal items in the baggage sizing tray to make sure they were up to par before letting them proceed to security line, created a long unnecessary line just to size bags and many people were told their personal items were oversized despite clearly being small enough to fit under the seat, and were made to go back to the check-in desk agent to pay 30$ per bag to check in a small personal item (and go through another line, no less). No other airline was doing this except for Air Canada. I travel frequently, approximately every 6 weeks and travel carry-on only, my backpack was also refused despite having taken this backpack on Air Canada and other airlines multiple times before and fitting perfectly well under the seat as my personal item, and when I brought this up to the agent they said 'that was before, we're auditing people now'. Despite being 3 hours early to the airport, we still only made it to our gate 15 mins before boarding because of this unnecessary hassle. The AC agents were so rude, creating unnecessary delays. Will not be flying Air Canada again.	0
Very frustrating experience with Air Canada. Overbooked, assigned seats separately and not able to change that to have seats together. Crew was not helpful and very irritated, makes you feel sorry that you asked anything. After continuous delays, when we finally started disembarkation the crew was very eager to leave the plane and rushed us in a rude manner.	0
I flew Dubai-Toronto (4 hour layover) and Toronto-Montreal on June 15th/16th 2022. Two things happened on this trip, first, the Boeing 787-9 (long haul flight) upkeep and comfort was in dark contrast to the Airbus A220-300 used for the 1 hour flight. Yes, the Airbus A220-300 was a much more comfortable flight in everyway. Second, I arrived in Montreal after a very very long journey and had to wait in the understaffed luggage claims line, for another hour, with 30 or so other passengers from exclusively AC flights, all of us with missing luggage, confused and tired. During this wait, we witnessed the comedy act of airport security walling off the luggage carrousel which was overpiling with late / delayed lost baggage. No information was shared other than, we will let you know, enjoy your stay in Canada. After 2 weeks of calling, filing in useless complaints reports on AC's website and making trips to the airport, I was finally re-united with one bag, which was in a 3rd party storage facility a 15 mins drive from the airport, the 2nd bag was delivered the following day. Compensation? fill in another report and attach your receipts (what justification can you give a passenger for delaying their baggage for 2 weeks, I flew to your hub in Toronto for God's sake, the layover was 4 hours how did you misplace the luggage?). During this time all the communication and effort was one way, this is a disgusting level of due diligence from an airline which promotes itself as excellence. This is not excellence, this is utter garbage. On my return flight I flew premium economy, little did I know, I would experience the novelty of skipping a hot meal on a flight for the 1st time in my life, the food was inedible. In September (3 months after my flight) an AC customer service agent emails me stating ''we have decided to compensate you for your 14 day delayed baggage, we are happy to give $400 CAN. $400 CAN for losing my luggage for 2 weeks. On top of that, the customer service agent instructs me to share all, and I mean ALL, of my banking info. so that they could transfer this meagre payoff. Why? They do not have a system which allows transfer's to customer's living abroad.  its 2022, I used a credit card to pay for the flight, all details of which are logged and registered on your system, at least, a normally functioning company's system. I have now spent 2 weeks advising AC that it is unacceptable to make such a statement (international transfers) and unacceptable to ask your passengers to share their bank details online via email. Air Canada as an airline is a total disgrace to Canada.	0
New York-Moscow to Delhi return. On our way to Moscow we found the flight attendants to be rude and unhelpful (and of course not smiling). During the 7 hr layover we became concerned about the mere 1 hr layover on our return trip. It sounded good when we booked it but realizing that we would have to run through security and the length of the airport to get to our flight we didn't think it would be possible. We stopped to ask a woman behind a customer service desk and she said "yes not enough time" waved her hand at us and we were dismissed. Getting onto the plane to Delhi we realized our seats were not together. We once again tried to get an answer and was ignored. Very unhelpful and rude. For the return flight we had to change flights in the office in Delhi. Come to find out that there was another flight out of Moscow with a 3 hour layover. We switched to that flight. The office workers in Delhi were also cold and rude. As it turns out by the time we landed from Delhi in Moscow and got to the terminal to fly out that 1 hour layover flight had already left. We would have been stranded in Moscow for who know how long because nobody would have acknowledged our existence let alone get us onto a flight. Oh and did I mention I had ordered veg. meals? On the way to Delhi I did receive delicious meals on the return flights no such luck. I had bread.	0
Flew Glasgow to Toronto with Air Canada Rouge. Worst flight in years. Seats not comfortable. No overhead storage for our luggage. Poor breakfast, late on take off with no reason given until pressured by some of the passengers. 2.5 hours late on boarding. Went by section and never asked for elderly or young children to board first. Lukewarm tea and ages to get hot tea. Food bad. All managers should be forced to fly this plane on all business flights for 2 years to understand how bad it was.	0
I normally go to USA every year. This time my agent bought me and wife return tickets to fly from Brisbane to Minneapolis. Normally I used two flights to travel from Brisbane to Minneapolis. But it appeared that this trip had three flights via Canada. All the flights were delayed and we miss the one from Montreal to Minneapolis and had to spend time at the airport over night. The return trip back to Australia was worse again all flights were delayed over 4 hours and we miss the one from Vancouver to Brisbane. They put us up in a hotel in Vancouver and promised to pay all expenses. But when receipts for expenses were submitted they refused saying that it was due to computer glitches. Moreover, we were put on two flights from Vancouver one from vancouver Sydney and the other from Sydney to Brisbane which means we had 4 flights from Minneapolis to Brisbane. Each trip took 2 days instead of 1 day. When landed at Brisbane one of luggage was missing and it took 2 days to get it back. Never fly Air Canada.	0
Air Canada lost our luggage on day one of our once a year vacation. 11 days later still no luggage. They have no idea what they have done with it. Because they delayed our flight and changed our flight 4 times causing this catastrophe.	0
Guadalajara to Santiago de Chile via Mexico City. Very bad experience, the Aeromexico flight was delayed for 6 hours in Mexico City, they didn't say the reason of the delay, so we left Mexico City at 5:30 am and landed in Santiago in the afternoon. I lost a very important meeting that day in Santiago. On my way back from Santiago to Guadalajara with a stop in chaotic Mexico City airport, the connection process to Guadalajara was very bad. My electronic boarding pass was not accepted by the airport authorities and they asked me to go to Aeromexico to obtain a printed boarding pass, there was a huge line in Aeromexico to get printed boarding pass. When I arrived finally in Guadalajara my luggage didn't arrive. Leason learned, I will never fly again to South America with Aeromexico.	0
Don't believe Aer Lingus if they say they will refund any costs for a cancelled flight! Fog caused cancelled flight (not their fault) but from there on service was atrocious! Kept waiting at the airport for 2 hours until someone said what would happen, then offered a taxi home (great!). However when I tried to reclaim the costs got the following response. "Aer Lingus will not cover accommodation or transport costs if a Guest opts for a refund following a flight cancellation. This will apply only if the Guest retains their booking, and reschedules for a later date." £275 taxi costs now borne by my company - its a joke! Shame I cant give a minus number.	0
Flew from Manchester to Toronto. If you have an alternative then take it. I take about 20 flights a year on various airlines. Air Canada rouge has been the worst. The food is poor, its poor on Air Canada too. There's no TV, you have to take your own iPad or similar, and there's nowhere to charge it. They even charge you for using your own iPad and your own electricity. All alcohol is paid for and tickets are not cheap. It's a budget airline at premium prices. Easyjet could teach them a thing or two. I only used the flight to avoid having to fly via London. They should take the e off the end of rouge and put an h there. Air Canada Rough, much closer to the facts.	0
Barcelona to San francisco via Montreal with Air Canada rouge. I'm a frequent traveller and this airline has been one of the worst ones I've tried. From customer service to plane. I'm a Star Alliance gold member and on both flights, I was seated completely separated from my wife and we were on the same booking. It doesn't help the staff were impolite and we were delayed. No seatback entertainment either and even if you download the app, the movie selection is old. It's sad really, I heard a lot of bad things but expected the staff service to be good so I wanted to give them a proper shot. I was wrong. Believe the reviews. It's a budget airline for a reason. This was the only airline arriving at the time I needed in SFO, if there were other options, I definitely would've gone the other way.	0
The price was affordable but the service was lousy. When I arrived at my final destination I realized that they lost my checked-in baggage for which I paid 250 euros! . At the counter they told me that they would solve my problem in 3 days and I have been waiting almost 1 month for information about my luggage, unbelievable. The customer service is really bad, I had to wait up to 1 hour every day I called to be attended! The other thing I wanted to emphasize was the punctuality of this airline. Unfortunately, I had to fly back with this airline and to make matters worse I missed my last flight connection from Brussels to Hamburg because the plane landed 1 hour late in Brussels. The boarding gate was slammed in my face ... I waited 6 hours, after Air Canada rebooked my flight with Lufthansa, which means that I waited around 6 hours more in order to arrive to my final destination. Please avoid traveling with this irresponsible airline.	0
Worst international flight experience ever. Unhelpful staff, terrible food and an additional charge for drinks (something I've never experienced on any other international flight). At one point on the return journey I asked an air hostess for a blanket. She told me to go search for one myself on one of the empty seats. It was dark onboard and I couldn't see a thing. I again went to ask another air hostess for a blanket and she also told me to look myself. When I explained it was dark and I didn't want to go rummaging around peoples seats she went to look but had a terrible attitude. They had the same limited movie/tv selection on the return flight as the flight over. I have never felt compelled to write a review of a service before, but I feel others should know before booking how below standard Aer Lingus are when compared to other airlines. I would definitely recommend going for Virgin atlantic or British Airways. If you're travelling from Ireland, this will mean getting a connecting flight from London. But it is worth it if you value comfort on a long haul flight.	0
Houston to Delhi via Beijing with Air China. Horrifying. I've traveled to over 50 countries and have never seen anything like this. I was unfortunate enough to have been trapped at Beijing on the 5th November when the weather caused 494 flights to be cancelled. While Air China cannot control the weather, they can control the horrific customer service provided afterwards. Here is a list of the things I endured from Air China: Rerouted to Shenyang and left on the tarmak for hours without food or water or communication as to why we weren't in Beijing. No food vouchers given at Shenyang. Stood in line for 4 hours to speak with a customer service rep and was put on a flight back to Beijing on China Southern because Air China had a mechanical error with their plane. When I got to Beijing, Air China had given my seat to someone else. No explanation, and wouldn't help me. This caused me to miss my train in Delhi and had to book a last minute flight for $100. Was forced to stand in line for 7.5 hours in Beijing to speak to another customer service representative. No hotel vouchers given. I had to sleep on the floor of the Beijing airport. No food vouchers given again. Never, ever fly with this airline.	0
I've been a long time user of Air Canada flight passes and up until now they have worked well for me and my family. I don't know what has changed with Air Canada but be aware they are not what they use to be. I booked my Wife with her flight pass and selected her seat. At this time the plane was just over half full. Immediately after booking her seat I tried to book my own seat with my flight passes. I got an online response back saying the plane was sold out even though I could plainly see there was over 40 seats left unsold. I called customer service only to be told my flight pass was an M class ticket and there were no M class seats available. The only reason I purchase flight passes in the first place was to be able to book my flights in the busy season knowing I could always get a seat. 80% of the time the regular economy fare is much cheaper than the cost of a single flight pass. Once again Air Canada you have taken the lead as one of the worlds worst airline for service communication and performance. The last couple of years I really thought you were getting your act together in these very tough times. But now it looks like you are falling back to your monopolistic, don't give a damn take it or leave it ways.	0
Plane was tired but clean, staff were dreadful. Saw the staff with a meal at the beginning of the night flight and then again at breakfast time before landing. No drinks even water offered through the night. Family with two year old twins behind me, never witnessed any help or a reassuring word offered to them. The staff didn’t really have a pleasant word for anyone. Went to the toilet in the night and it was awful, smelt and the seat was very dirty, needed checking a little more often. Breakfast was a brown paper bag with a croissant and plain yoghurt, the croissant was so cold it really was inedible, so as you might have gathered we won’t be flying air Canada again	0
I flew Aer Lingus from San Francisco to Venice via Dublin return. I have flown most of the major airlines and I never experienced such horrible treatment, especially on transatlantic flights. When I got in my seat for the Venice to Dublin flight there was a paper cup left in the pocket from the previous traveler. On the flight from Dublin to SFO, a 10.5 hour flight, I was given a meal in the first hour of the flight and what might be considered a sandwich the last hour. In between the cabin crew turned into concession sales people peddling the most atrocious snacks. After the initial beverage service the cabin crew did not come around once to offer water. If you wanted water you had to go to the "concession stand" and ask for it. Then, I received a feedback survey from Aer Lingus and the survey didn't come up. It read could not find the server. Nice to know that they really don't want to know how their service is, with the way they run their airline.  I wouldn't want to know either, unless I was really interested in improving.	0
On 17 Jul 22, my family and I traveled under Air Canada (AC) booking # 4GN88Y to catch a flight (flight # AC8927) from Toronto (TOR) to Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT) leaving Toronto-Pearson IAP at 2030 hrs. We had arrived earlier in the day around 1630 to TOR on AC flight AC897 from Athens, Greece an exhausting/grueling 10-hour flight. We had about a four-hour layover between flights. Around 2025 hrs, just before our scheduled boarding time, an AC rep, announced over the PA system there could be a delay of about a 1/2 hour - hour, as a co-pilot had not arrived for our flight. Surprisingly, around 2045 hrs, the AC rep announced we all would board the plane for PIT. All PIT passengers boarded the flight for PIT, after about 15 - 20 mins we were informed by the pilot that the co-pilot hadn't arrived, the flight was canceled, and we had to deplane & go back in the terminal and see AC personnel on the 3rd floor for assistance in rebooking our flight. My family/all of the PIT-bound passengers deplaned & went inside, where an AC rep let us know we would have to go through Customs (Again!), and try to get rebooked on another PIT flight. This would be the last information an in-person AC rep gave us at TOR IAP, and things became very disorganized. We made it through customs and went to retrieve our bags no AC rep was there to give guidance/assistance (took over an hour!). The AC area was a catastrophe complete with crying children & stressed-out adults who didn't know what to do. When we finally got my daughter’s luggage it was badly damaged (caster wheel missing/hard case cracked) the luggage was only a few yrs old, and cost around $100. We discussed renting a car (one-way to PIT) and driving home that night, as my wife and I had work the next day, and my daughter had a law school prep class. We were exhausted & just needed to get home. While my wife & daughter, who were exhausted & frustrated waited for our baggage, I went to the 3rd floor & tried to find an in-person AC rep, but to no avail, all AC personnel appeared to be gone for the day. An airport employee directed me to a bank of phones to contact AC for rebooking & to get a voucher for a hotel if we had to stay overnight. I called from the bank of phone got disconnected! However, a fellow passenger was able to get in touch with an AC ("Brian", I believe), who advised he could book my family on a AC Flight from TOR to PIT the next afternoon around 1415 hrs. He also advised he couldn't help with securing a hotel, but if we could manage to get a hotel room, we could submit the expenses to AC for "prompt" reimbursement. I asked Brian about getting reimbursed by AC for renting a car and driving home (one-way rental to PIT) he informed AC would definitely reimburse us for this expense, as well as fuel costs for the vehicle, if we submitted receipts to the AC website. Based upon the affirmative representation from an AC rep that we would be reimbursed for renting a vehicle (& fuel for vehicle) we made the decision to rent a car, which took over an hour and cost $300 we also incurred fuel and toll charges. Arrived home about 0545 hrs, totally stressed out and sick to our stomachs. Filed a claim with AC & after now about 45 days, all we have received is an auto reply email AC rec'd our claim. No reimbursement, no phone call from AC with an update, & certainly no apology from AC! All we ask is that someone from AC have the decency to help resolve this long-overdue claim.	0
Tel Aviv to Saint Louis via Toronto. This airline sucks! They had the rudest flight attendant that was waking people up and running around trying to enforce a mask rule. Karen of the skies. Then they would not let me on the flight to Saint Louis in Toronto as they said I had to fly with my bags? They rerouted me to Chicago with our my permission then proceeded to cancel the flight. I had to stay in Toronto overnight. Then to add insult to injury they lost my bags for 3 days. No way to get a hold of them, no apology. RUN!!	0
I had a trip to Barcelona and returned back to Toronto yesterday (Oct 18, 2015) by Aer Lingus. Instead of sharing to my friends of my great time in Barcelona, I have to share my terrible experience with Aer Lingus. I took EI0563 from Barcelona to Dublin and then EI0129 from Dublin to Toronto, the layover is 80 minutes. However, EI0563 arrived at Dublin about 30 minutes late so there was no much time left for the long line up security check and get to the gate for EI0129. When I finally got on the plane EI0129, the overhead storage bins were full. A flight attendant told me he would help me to find a space for my baggage and took it away. After a while he came back with a Baggage Identification Tag telling me that when I exit the plane I would get my baggage with the tag. When the plane arrived at Toronto airport, I showed tag to a flight attendant and requested by baggage back. However I was told to get my baggage at pick-up area. I was confused as it was a carry-on, not a checked-in baggage. I went to baggage pick-up area and got my baggage. It had strong smell of wine. I was shocked after I opened it : it was full of broken glasses of bottle wine which I bought at duty free store in Barcelona airport, broken porcelain souvenirs which were very valuable and bought from several cities in Spain, and clothes soaking in red wine. I was very confused and sad for what had happened. The flight attendant should have known the carry-on baggage was not suitable for checked-in baggage for a variety of reasons. They never checked with me what was inside and if it was appropriate to send it to checked-in baggage area.	0
I almost lost my connecting flight to Egypt because I arrived late at Montreal. Some of the staff members don’t even know that you don’t need to follow the Arrive CAN protocol if you are going to Canada just to connect flights. To top it all, on my way to Egypt the aircraft had the most uncomfortable seats. For an international flight that takes over 10hrs this aircraft has horrendous seats.	0
Air Canada has been my worst experience. Their customer service is one of the worst.  I was asleep and the cabin crew just passed the breakfast box to me, without waking me up or asking if I wanted to have. I was travelling with a my 15 years old son who has special needs (autism and hypermobility) and requires a lounge for calmness, the lady at the desk was so rude, suggesting that I go to lounges to see if they would let me in.  It is my first and last time taking Air Canada.	0
My Air Canada experience was my first and last. From a steward that wouldn’t let us carry on baggage (that we were able to on every other connecting flight) to delayed flights, canceled flights and re-routed flights. Then they topped it off by losing our luggage. They talk the talk but can’t walk the walk.	0
It was a traumatic experience to fly with them. I was denied boarding a flight that I had confirmed ticket for! The reason, they stated, was overbooking! I was not given any option but to choose another flight which was after few hours. My original flight was a direct flight from Toronto to Paris and they re-routed my trip via London Heathrow. I asked them multiple times to check if my luggage was on board. They assured me that my luggage was transferred to the new flight. It's been more than a week now and my luggage is still missing! I was off to Europe on my vacation for a week and I just had to spend it without my luggage. I cannot curse this airline enough to ruin my vacation completely. There is no customer service at all.	0
I flew Aeromexico to Guadalajara due to my father sickness, and after a few day there I decided to stay a few extra days so I called Aeromexico to postpone my fly back to the USA. I figured I had to pay a penalty of a $100.00 dollars since I did that with another airline a few weeks before. They told me that the penalty was $240 - I told the person on the other end that that was crazy since my I only paid $178 dollars for the air fare. After we discussed the options, I had I decided to just not show and buy another ticket, however they told me there there will be a $150.00 dollar charge for no show. I had enough of this nonsense. I called another airline to book a fly back home. I'll never use Aeromexico again.	0
Travelling from Athens to Santorini in August 2014. Flight was delayed. Not enough seats in airport lounge. No drinks provided. Only given a cookie. Travellers allowed to take extra hand luggage onto flight so there was not enough room for people who only had the one designated bag. We then had our return flight - we called the airline and asked if possible could we get on an earlier flight back to Athens if there were sears available. We were told seats were available most of the earlier flights however it would cost us euro 112 per person to catch the earlier flight. Offered us a 20% discount on a full new fare. Online price was only euro 117 to 131. We had initially purchased the two seats for euro 300. This spoilt our European vacation. We could understand a small penalty to changed however to charge a complete new ticket when there were empty seats available and there are numerous flights back and forth from Santorini to Athens.	0
Was leaving Beijing to Singapore on Air China with my family. We check in 3 hours before our departure at gate E26. Less than 45 minutes before departure, the gate changed to E51. It happens sometimes and as usual, the announcement is not clear. To go from E26 to E51 is a long way as we are not familiar with airport terminal 3, I understand later there is a short cut to go to E51. But you only have less than 45 minutes before departure to make your way to E51, We just follow the signboards instructions. We were rushing from one end to another. But what really annoyed me is that there is not a single customer service officer/staff at the gate E51. A customer service officer appeared about 10 minutes before the original departure (1535 hrs). This is the first time, I have encountered such poor quality of service from a national carrier. The flight was delayed about under 2 hours before departure. Their ground operation's customer service quality is appalling.	0
I was looking forward to flying with Air Canada rouge from Toronto to Montego Bay Jamaica but was very disappointed with the whole experience. The flight was delayed (not weather related). The seating was a joke, families were separated all over the plane. If you booked ahead you were put at the back of the plane and had no option to change your seat unless you paid more. The service onboard was terrible and the stewardess waited for people to come to them. Told one person who had been buzzing that she thought they hit it by mistake. They all just hung out at the back of the plane, I was in row 51 and could tell you all they did was talk to each other. If someone asked for something they made you feel like you where bothering them. The infighting enertament is so out dated. 	0
Flew Toronto to Phoenix, AZ. While the seats were very tight with hardly any leg room, my biggest disappointment was with the baggage. I purposely packed carry-on so I could avoid checking a bag. However when we got to the gate, they asked people to check bags as it was a full flight and ensured us that we would get them off first (along with getting seated prior to economy boarding). Those of us checking our bags were told to leave them in the 'tunnel' just before getting on the plane. When we arrived in Phoenix, none of the bags that were checked last minute made it onto the plane. The Air Canada agent that was at the baggage claim in Phoenix was very inconsiderate and repeatedly told us to wait (even though we had all been waiting over an hour at this point). We all filled out forms for our bags to be delivered to our destinations. Very disappointed with Air Canada rouge.	0
Air Canada rouge from Fort Lauderdale to Toronto. The worst was not the cramped seats, but the way that the airline breaks up families who travels together. My wife was assigned four rows behind me. My son was 30 rows back at the very end of the plane. All these to punish us for not paying the $15 seat selection!	0
They messed up our flight multiple times, where we were stuck because of this for 3 days. Our checked bagged was returned to us with stuff taken and bag ripped. They gave us a measly discount of 30%, when we were through so much exhaustion and we had rude team members not wanting to help	0
Horrible, just horrible. If you can fly with a decent company, please avoid Air Canada (I know I will). My early flight got cancelled for some obscure reason. There were two other direct flights to the same destination on the same day, but the customer service didn't bother to try and put me on them. I spoke with at least 8 different people on the phone, and they all told me different things. All were acting as if it were my fault that the company cancelled the flight. I went to the airport, trying to get on one of the direct flights. After waiting for 45+ minutes in line (only two registration stands were open), I finally got to speak to someone. The person was very rude and again acted as if I were to blame for the cancellation. Anyways, after multiple phone calls I got a flight on the same day. It was later in the day and not direct, so super inconvenient. Because of Air Canada I missed a very important event and wasted my time trying to get some response from them. Like I said, don't fly them - they are unreliable and their customer support is terrible (okay, just one out of 8 people was actually helpful - the one who helped me book a new flights). AVOID	0
This is the worst trip I’ve ever experienced in my life. It started with each flight being delayed which it didn’t really affect my trip until I was coming back to Jeddah. It started when my flight got delayed in Minneapolis causing the missing of my next flight from Montreal to Cairo. I traveled with 4 kids and it was such a mess trying to catch the flight we’ve been rerouted to which is from Montreal to Athens. I asked the agent who printed our boarding passes if my luggage will be rerouted and she said yes! After a long, hard, tiring trip and a long wait in Athens, we made it Jeddah and guess what no luggage. I checked in 12 pieces of luggage none of them arrived and the worst is that Air Canada doesn’t want to file a claim for me stating they’re not the last carrier I traveled with. The other airline company doesn’t want to file a claim for me either stating that their name is not on the baggage tags. To summarize this, Air Canada is the worst airline company I’ve traveled with in term of service, food, timing, comfort and customer service. Will never fly air Canada again	0
Air Canada is terrible. I paid over $300.00 for a direct flight from Montreal to BWI. I could have purchased a ticket for $120.00 if a wanted a flight with stops. I selected the most expensive direct flight option. Thur flight got cancelled and replaced with a two flights Montreal to Toronto and Toronto to BWI. The flight from Montreal was very late. While I was in the air the second flight from Toronto to BWI got cancelled. According to the customer service no flight was available on the same day. They offered me to fly back to Montreal and from there to DC the next day. Then they instructed where to pick up my luggage. However, I couldn't find my checked in bag. I had to speak Air Canada rep and he told me that my bag got checked in for the next flight and would stay in the airport. I tried to explain that all my belongings were there but he didn't want to listen to me. I had to find an emergency accommodation and buy a few things to spend the afternoon and night in Toronto No assistance or accommodation was offered to me. Next day I flew to Montreal and I was assured that my bags were loaded on the flight. In Montreal I had to wait an hour before I was able to pass the custom office control because my luggage couldn't be found. It remained in Toronto. My flight to DC was rescheduled twice. Originally I was supposed to land around 3 PM but instead I landed after 5 PM. I still don't know where my luggage is. No compensation or even a simple apology was ever offered by Air Canada. I lost a precious vacation day because my original flight was cancelled. I had to spend extra money because my stay in Canada was extended against my will. I am feeling traumatized and abused by Air Canada. I can express how much stress and inconveniences Air Canada caused to me. They are unreliable and inconsiderate. I will never use Air Canada again. This company is a nightmare.	0
Sydney to Stockholm via Beijing with Air China. It began with the flight from Sydney to Beijing being 2 hours late. That made me, and many other people on the same flight to miss our transfer in Beijing. I was to catch a flight from Beijing onwards to Zurich and then from there to Stockholm. But as the flight delayed, the whole route got destroyed. I was stuck in Beijing airport where not a single person spoke English. Had to wait 7 hours until I got help and got booked on another plane headed straight to Stockholm without any transit. And guess what, the plane was delayed 1 hour. This was the first and most certainly the last time I'm flying with Air China, horrible airline and will avoid it.	0
Booked flights on Air China website to fly Montreal to Havana  and really should have trusted my gut instinct. Plus these reviews. Was ticketed to fly to Havana on 26 July and back to Montreal on 1 August as Air China only nonstop option. Air China sent me a schedule change in early June having me now arriving Havana at 2030h on 29 July and returning at 1000h the next day! 13.5 hours in Havana to savor a mojito and some architecture?  Called local reservations centre who advised no other available flights as Air China have reduced flights from 3 to 1 a week. Ok, understood. Further advised only option was to request refund online and rebook with alternative carrier. Done and flights purchased on Copa now at double price! Follow up emails to Air China (3 so far) asking about refund ETA have gone unanswered. Rubbish experience, lesson learned. Not worth the grief. You are warned.	0
Vancouver to Beijing. I've been traveling around the world for the last 20 years and pretty much tried all major airlines. Air China is hands down worst experience ever from every point of view. Besides the unappetizing food the flight attendant woke me up as the plane prepared to land, with a tap on the shoulder and with "hey wake up". My advice even if you pay couple of hundred dollars more chose any other airline and avoid transit in China where to change $20 in yuan for a coffee, the service charge is $10 for your transaction. 	0
Worst travel experience of my life. Supposed to be heading to Germany for a work convention. Flight was delayed out of Newfoundland which made us miss our connection in Toronto. So they tried to put us on a different flight with a different company but "couldn't" actually transfer our tickets because they used a European operator called Eurowings and we had already "checked in" at our original departure. So be aware if your Air Canada flight is operated by another company because they'll use that as an excuse to screw you over. If you're reading this Air Canada rep maybe don't make deals with other companies if you can't provide customer support. So now I'm stuck in Toronto, going to be over 24 hours late arriving to a work thing and they're doing everything not to help. Sure they gave us a hotel room for the night and $20 each in food vouchers for the airport but that doesn't begin to make up for the stress of all of this. Can't even call to get compensation because you have to "go online" so they can proceed to ignore your claims. Terrible company with even worse customer service. One lady did try to be helpful but here we are in the end, screwed over. If I could give a 0/10 I would.	0
Air Canada is the worst company. I’ll never fly with then again. They change our flights hour 3 different times, then after more the 4 hours delay they cancel the flight. I was travelling with my grandmother and my wife. They give to us a other flight, but they cancel it again. I needed to rental a car and drive 8 hours from Newark to Toronto to be at my home!	0
Lost luggage is a major problem for Air Canada as I learned the hard way. Lost 2/2 bags, huge line at Copenhagen airport of other Air Canada customers who similarly had lost luggage on multiple AC flights. What is most disconcerting is the number of large carts of lost luggage labeled with dates going back up to a week in full public access that had not even been touched by AC staff which makes me highly doubt the AC claim that they are doing everything they can to reunite lost luggage with travelers. If you are planning to travel with Air Canada, my advice is not to check bags right now.	0
Traveling Air Canada was not a good experience for me, all legs of my journey were late, returning - to the point I missed my flight and they could not get me on another flight until morning. I had to pay for the hotel myself, as they were out of hotel vouchers and told to submit for a refund online, which I did only to receive a response that it could take up to 30 days for someone to make contact with me. That was on July 11. It is now August 22 and I have yet to even be acknowledged, let alone refunded for my hotel. At this point I am frustrated and will never travel Air Canada again, if this is how they treat their customers.	0
Sunday 21st June, Shanghai to Mexico City Premier Class. Old aircraft with no Inflight Entertainment this situation bother me so much. There was also a complete lack of interest shown by the cabin crew in their jobs. Very disappointing. The flying experience was not be very good on Premier Class after I bought an upgrade from  economy class. 	0
Rhodes to Birmingham Saturday 5th July. Over eleven hours late with no explanation other than 'technical problems'. It should have left after nine hours but no staff were on duty to keep us informed and a 7.30 am flight finally took off at 7.16pm. The staff were miserable and surly. No route map on the inflight and the front toilet locked on both journeys.	0
Swiftair instead of Aegaen Rhodos to Zurich 5th July 2014. Instead an Aegean aircraft we had to board a nameless very old White MD 83. No announcements no apologies and a 2 hour delay! Onboard I found out that it was a Swiftair charter airline from Spain. Seat comfort very basic no magazines no monitors absolutely nothing. Very old noisy aircraft. I booked through the official homepage of Aegean and was very disappointed about this awful downgrading. Nevertheless the cabin Crew of Swiftair (except one Supervisor all Spaniards) did an acceptable job. The inbound flight ZRH to ATH was one hour late. But at least it was an Aegean aircraft. My next flights to Greece will be again on SWISS.	0
Phuket to London via Beijing with Air China. We have never been with an airline that seems to have no control of its customers. When trying to check in you are taken back to the 1960's everything takes 3 times longer than any other airline. When queuing with 5 people in front of you, it’s not - its 5 people holding 5 passports each! Then they proceed to check each person in calling them over from the other side of the airport. At this point you will have 90 minutes before checking in. Give the normal 3 hours to check in but don't expect to see duty free as it will take you 3 hours of waiting. Lastly Queuing is more like a cat fight. Don't move, don’t talk, don’t let them Push in (one nearly breaking my foot with the hard push into me). This is my third flight with Air China within 3 weeks from different airports, and the check-in process is the same across the full network. 	0
Copenhagen to Melbourne via Beijing. Do not fly Air China!! I flew with Air China for the first time in January 2016. The flight itself was not too bad, a bit old and dated, not the best food and the entertainment system was pretty useless (poor selection of movies/ shows, and was only working intermittently), however, nothing I can't put up with for the duration of 24 hours to get a cheap flight. My nightmare experience begun when Air China sent me a change of schedule email for my return flight, which is in July, which did not fit with when I needed to be back in Europe so I called the Australian number provided on their website, to change my ticket. Nowhere is it stated that it is a very expensive pay number, so I ran out of credit while waiting in the phone queue before I even got to talk to anyone. I somehow managed to find a free phone number which operates between 10am-5pm, but calling this number means you're connected to somewhere else in the world (they must not have an Australian office??) where conveniently enough it's always night time and no supervisors or managers are present. Dealing with the call center staff is painful as the vast majority of them are incompetent and give conflicting information, the night staff seem particularly unable to answer any questions and are generally useless. It took me six weeks and over ten calls, not to mention how much phone credit, to change my flight, and all but the last person I spoke to blamed the Beijing office. Strangely the last person I spoke to managed to change and confirm my new ticket within five minutes. She was obviously one of those rare people who actually knew what she was doing. Three weeks later I got an automated email informing me that the second leg of my return trip, Beijing-Copenhagen, had been cancelled, just like that! No information on why or what to do to get a refund - nothing!! Again I called the AU Air China call centre, was advised that I'd get a full refund because Air China was responsible for the cancellation, it would take 3-4 weeks to process though. A confirmation email was supposed to be sent to me but never arrived so I called again a few days later, they blamed my email and then proceded to tell me that the first person I had spoken to was wrong to say that I'd get a full refund- that was up to the Beijing office. Long story short, over the past 8 weeks I have spoken to five different people who have all given me different information about how much I'll be refunded and when. All of them failed to inform me of/ send me the refund form that apparently has to be filled out in order for them to start processing the refund. I only found that out yesterday when I spent $20 on a 10 minute international call to try to get hold of a supervisor or manager to complain about this ordeal. The latest news is that I will (probably) be refunded for the second leg of the flight (Beijing- Copenhagen) but not for the one from Melbourne to Beijing as that is still departing according to schedule!? So I should go to Beijing and be stuck there, or only get a partial refund? It will also take at least 7-8 weeks before any money gets paid back into my account. So for someone like me, who doesn't have a lot of money, I had to borrow money to buy a new ticket with Thai Airways so that I can get home for my holiday, I have spent way too much time and money trying to sort this out and still have to wait two months before I potentially get any money back. I will never fly Air China again!	0
Flew Air Canada rouge from Toronto to Barbados. Inflight service crew unfriendly - did not see them smile once until passengers were leaving the plane. Both flights I had to endure other passengers watching movies on their devices without head phones/ear buds at a loud volume, not acceptable, or enjoyable, not my place to confront the passenger. Disappointed flyer.	0
Run don't walk from any flight on Air Canada Rouge. I've flown it a couple of times and the service, seats and entertainment are terrible. On a recent trip to Cancun from Montreal, there was no water in any of the economy bathrooms. They didn't even provide water bottles for washing your hands. The seats are so close together, you become very intimate with the seat in front of you. There is no entertainment unless you want to rent one of their tables or download an app to watch on yours. 	0
I will never fly Air Canada again. Gate staff are inflexible. Our flight from Rome to Toronto was delayed thus we missed our connection to San Francisco. There were about 10 people on the flight that had to make this connection. The Staff at customer service had called the gate and let the gate staff know we were all running to the gate to make the flight and to please allow us to board. We got there 5 minutes after they closed the doors, the airplane had not moved from the gate, but they would not let us on. This I accept as I’m unclear about FAA rules once an airplane door is closed. What I don’t accept is the absolute incompetence of booking us on different flights, losing our luggage, and having absolute no remorse about treating passengers like cattle. Every nightmare you read about plane travel occurred, which I accept that it’s a difficult time for this industry, but I do not accept the rudeness of staff, total apathy to help customers.	0
Terrible experience in YUL with a rude supervisor at baggage drop who charged me 100$ for 2-3 kgs above weight. I was never charged these fees in Geneva. The company applies different policy in different countries. Also, the food is terrible on this flight.  Flights always delayed.	0
Absolutely worst customer service. Do not fly this airline. The boarding staff are rude, aggressive, and completely without compassion. They force you to check your carry on despite it being a half empty flight or denying boarding with zero support. I had a terrible experience in NY and my girlfriend was denied boarding out of St. Louis despite having passport information, global entry, an enhanced licensed — everything!	0
Calgary to Delhi via Toronto. This was most terrible experience I ever had with Air Canada. Worst flight and customer service ever. Less than 12 hours, I was informed that my flight has been changed. That caused my husband to auto cancel his flight. The new scheduled flight from YYC - YYZ was scheduled at 1300 but got delayed by 45 mins. which made my connection tight at YYZ. I had almost 1 hour to connect with my flight from YYZ but due to some reason, when plane reached YYZ, it didn't connected with gate for almost an hour and I had to rush to my gate with my carry-on and an infant in 10 mins. The gate was closed and I was a min. or 2 away to miss my flight to DEL. After arriving DEL, I waited for my baggage to arrive for 2 hours, no luck. I asked Air Canada for help, they wrote down my info and gave me my baggage tag numbers only not the file ref. no. My husband in YYC contacted Air Canada who registered the complaint for missing luggage and gave him file ref. no. My first red bag arrived after 5 days, which had all milk supplies for my infant. My 2nd bag was delayed and arrived after 10 days because they forgot to pick my 2nd bag. In addition, both rear wheels of the baggage arrived broken. Left wheel is missing and right wheel is not aligned with the bag. This is the WORST flight of my life. I will never fly Air Canada again.	0
I really don't understand the bad reviews. I flew LHR to LAX and both flights were excellent. Great friendly flight attendants and good food and IFE. Seat was comfortable and economy no more cramped than on more expensive airlines. Amazing value for money can't wait to fly Air New Zealand again.	1
We travelled from London to Toronto (return flight) 22nd May and 30th May with 1 child. First time Air Transat user and had read the reviews so was very very apprehensive. However we were very impressed with the speed of check-in (both times) extremely quick through the queue. The service on board was good (only one attendant was rather abrupt but not rude) food was fine. The inflight entertainment worked fine each time although they charge £5 for headphones. Both flights were on time. Temperature on board was comfortable and there were plenty of refreshments. We would definitely use this airline again and it was good value for money.	1
I flew with Air France from Paris Charles de Gaulles to Nice Côte d'Azur and It was an enjoyable journey. The aircraft was looking new and clean, cabin crews were smiley, friendly and helpful. Really enjoyed flying with Air France.	1
I've flown long haul with Virgin and their Premium Economy product is excellent but Air New Zealand's just takes it that one notch above (although it does cost slightly more too). Firstly the seat - it's in a shell so the seat tilts and slides rather than reclines into the space behind you. You're also angled slightly and so if you're in the outer seats you're not obliged to talk to the person next to you - it's your own personal space. I paid the extra for seats at the front of the cabin and they're well worth the upgrade - so much legroom and easy to get in and out (useful if travelling solo). The centre seats are better for couples as you can share the space. Check their website for information. The food was excellent served on crockery with metal cutlery. You'll get your starter etc first and wait some time for the hot meal meanwhile your dessert is also sat in front of you being very tempting! The hot food was good although the menu options were a little unusual - both times I went for the fish as the other options (beef and chicken) contained various things I didn't care for. The service was impeccable - the staff were very friendly except one attendant who seemed a little off although still professional. Inflight entertainment is on a decent sized touch screen although there is also a remote in the side of the seat. The selection was surprising - there were a large number of retro movies rather than all the latest blockbusters (of which there were few). However this was actually quite nice as I watched a few older favourites rather than having to gamble on new choices. My favourite thing about the IFE was being able to order drinks and snacks from the screen. Just tap an option or two and it's delivered to your seat a few minutes later whilst you continue to watch your movie. All seats have USB sockets for charging and I think you can link them up to a USB drive but I didn't test this. Also charging sockets are available for your laptop. You can use a standard UK plug as well as US and some other options. The toilets! Firstly two toilets dedicated to Premium Economy - so no queuing. And they were the best - fancy wallpaper with funny fake bookshelves on it (read some of the titles) and music piped in too. Frankly I would pay the upgrade just for those! Finally when flying to the USA you are right near the front of the plane so you're off quickly and can hot foot it to immigration to hopefully beat the queues. Unless you have ridiculously high standards of what you expect from a metal tube flying through the air I don't think you'll be disappointed.	1
Having flown Air Transat now for several years to Canada I have always found them to be efficient and helpful during booking and flight even when crossings did not go to plan. My last return flight from Calgary to Manchester May 25th however was a delight. After boarding from what must be the worlds most miserable staffed airport in Calgary the cabin crew could not have done more to revive my good spirits. The flight was smooth and on time and we were well supplied with excellent food and refreshment throughout. Despite the long journey the cabin crew remained attentive and cheerful and added good humour. I am due to fly again in October and am looking forward to the trip. I just hope that someone teaches the Canadian security how to smile.	1
Amritsar to Delhi. The snacks provided on the flight of just an hour is amazing. Great service keep it up. North American airlines are nowhere close to the service provided by Air India, I really enjoyed the hospitality.	1
London to Delhi. An excellent service and experience. This was my first time travelling with AI and I was amazed with service from ground staff to onboard. I'm looking forward flying with AI again in future.	1
Flew Kochi to Dubai. My first experience of Air India's Dreamliner fleet, it was fabulous, for a change the in-flight services and crew were absolutely superb, just like the way you get treated in premium routes like London-Kochi, superb experience. Seats were wide enough, superb legroom, good food, nice service, superb interiors and amazing flight. Keep it up Air India.	1
Brussels to Johannesburg via Paris. Last time I flew with Air France was probably 10 years ago. It's usually not in my preferred list because of reputation and pricing. It has changed since this journey! First of all, we left Brussels by train to reach Paris CDG, that was a first for me and I got two nice surprises. First of all, you check your luggage directly at the train station and it follows you until the final destination (which it did), secondly, despite our Premium Economy ticket and the fact that the train ticket were supposed to be Economy class, we got first class seats in the TGV. That was a nice start. No trouble from the station to the airport, boarding was just fine, crew members very nice and friendly, I was pretty impressed as my expectations were way lower than that. The cabin was neat, plane was clean, and  the food was probably one of the best food I ate on a plane, despite being only Premium Economy, it was better than my last Business class trip.  Then comes the time to check the entertainment system, once again, I was surprised. The usual list of movies, few games and info, pretty classic but efficient, and, the nice touch is the music selection. I found a real selection of my favourite genre, and, I mean real like latest albums, various renown artists but not mainstream. Well, I sticked to the movies anyway, but that was a nice touch, I appreciated it. The way there and return were both equally nice, Boeing 777 and Airbus A380, everything was really nice and for once, I'd recommend Air France despite my initials feelings.	1
Munich to Paris CDG. As I have mostly heard negative reviews about Air France, I was prepared for the worst. I was wrong. Check In in both Munich and Paris was a breeze. We were on Sky Priority which meant that we could board the plane first and our luggage was delivered first as well. The cabin was neat, very tidy and an excellent inflight magazine is available. Only downside is the seat pitch. The crew on both flights was absolutely amazing. Very professional and attentive, a warm smile and everyone spoke great english, some flight attendands also spoke german too. Another surprise was the delicious snack we received and the great variety of beverages offered. It was a flight of one hour and Air France and its crew did an outstandig job. I'm looking forward to fly with them again.	1
Flew May 2nd from Vancouver to Manchester! I was really pleased with the airline and staff. I have paid a lot more in the past and not received as good a service! My personal TV screen froze halfway through the flight so I couldn't use it but that didn't really bother me as I just went to sleep and no one else seemed to be experiencing the same problem. I am flying back on May 23rd with my dog so that is going to be the worrying part but hopefully everything will go smoothly! I also got option plus would recommend to anyone! Is not that much extra and jut the priority baggage made my trip a lot easier!	1
Really enjoyed this short flight from London to Paris CDG! The aircraft was looking new, flight departed on time, friendly cabin crews and nice Pain au Chocolat for breakfast was served for this 45 mins flight. Looking forward to fly with Air France in the future.	1
Flown Air NZ on the MEL-AKL-VAN and return 3 times over the last 2 years and have enjoyed the experience very much flown on both B777-200ER and B777-300 in economy and felt comfortable despite being 6ft 2in. Meals are excellent and so is the service as well as a wide variety of drinks and snacks available throughout the whole flight. Vast entertainment selection with something for everybody. My seat on my recent flight from Auckland to Vancouver had a faulty remote for the entertainment screen and the flight attendant was very helpful in trying to fix the issue whilst we were heading to the runway but couldn't so he said wait till we take off and I could move to another seat that has a working remote and this was the only seat left in economy which had only improved my view on Air NZ.	1
London to Mumbai.  The departure was delayed a bit due to a medical emergency on the inbound flight.  Crew started drinks service accompanied by a pack of peanuts. Drinks included apple, orange juice, whiskey, water. As I opted for the veg option, the lunch consisted of paneer kofta with rice and vegetables with a bun, salad and kheer for dessert. The meal was quite tasty and filling which was good. Afterwards, the IFE kept me occupied for most part of the flight. The IFE was not expansive but for a 9 hour journey managed to keep me occupied. The crew dimmed the windows after lunch to make passengers get some sleep. Before landing, supper was provided which consisted of a samosa, veg cutlet and panner tikka with a bun, fruits and gulab jamun for dessert. Arrival in Mumbai was delayed by 35 mins. The seats were quite comfortable, the crew were a bit stiff but provided regular drinks. However, at the end of the flight the cabin area was a complete mess with blankets and debris all over the floor. Would travel with them again on this sector.	1
Mumbai to London. I was happy with the experience on this flight. For breakfast I opted for the vegetarian option, a veg cutlet, stuffed parathas and bhurji was provided along with a croissant, fruits and tea.  The inflight entertainment was ample. I managed to get a few hours of sleep as well. The seats are comfortable enough. The crew were very polite and professional and provided regular drinks. Before landing lunch was served. Once again opted for the veg course of vegetables with rice and rajma followed by dessert and tea. The quality and quantity of food served aboard this flight was excellent. The fact that steel cutlery was used instead of plastic forks/knives was quite impressive. Would fly again with Air India and recommend this.	1
I had travelled on the early morning flight from Mumbai to London on this Air India flight and was pleasantly happy with the experience on this flight. The flight departed on time and the load on this sector was quite a bit. After takeoff, the breakfast service commenced and as I had opted for the vegetarian option, a veg cutlet, stuffed parathas and bhurji was provided along with a croissant, fruits and tea. The breakfast was very tasty and sumptuous. The inflight entertainment was ample for this 9 hour journey and had sufficient programs to keep one occupied. I also managed to get a few hours of sleep aswell in economy class. The seats are comfortable enough and there is ample legroom. Quite possibly the best legroom for intercontinental flights in economy. The crew were very polite and carried out their tasks with utmost professionalism and provided regular drinks of water/juice to the passengers. Before landing the crew distributed immigration cards and also lunch was served. Once again opted for the veg course which consisted of mixed vegetables with rice and rajma followed by dessert and tea. The quality and quantity of food served aboard this flight was excellent and we arrived also perfectly on time which was excellent. The fact that steel cutlery was used instead of plastic forks/knives was quite impressive. Would definitely fly again with Air India and recommend this.	1
Flew HKG-AKL-CHC then AKL-YVR with Air NZ as part of a round-the-world itinerary. Their service is second-to-none even in economy. One of the flights was on a refitted B777-200ER and although narrower the new-style seat was very comfortable and I slept well in it.	1
4th Nov NZ 175. We flew from Auckland to Perth in the excellent new Dreamliner - what a plane! The seats were the best business class seats we have had the pleasure of traveling in so far. The entertainment system was superb and very easy to use. The food was 5 star restaurant quality and as usual great friendly staff. We were amazed to how great we felt after a 7 hour flight and the hostess said that is because of the cabin pressure in the new Dreamliners we have had no jet lag and slipped into Perth time straight away. Can't wait for our return flight home!	1
Wedding party going to Grand Bahia Principe Mexico from Calgary April 9 2014 was a smooth trip looked to be a newer plane the flight attendants appeared to be a bit frazzled and in a hurry. I had to ask frequently for water and a possible newspaper to which I never received. The trip back to Calgary April 16 2014 was also a smooth flight. The flight attendants were an excellent group of attentive professionals with charismatic humour and precision service.	1
We flew twice with Air NZ this month once from Vancouver to Auckland and once from Auckland to Hong Kong. On each occasion we were really impressed by the service. The food was great (more than I could eat on on occasion) the sensitivity to those wanting to sleep and those wanting to be provided food and or drink was terrific and the smiles seemed to be genuine (even at the end of a long haul flight - some achievement). We flew Economy Class Air NZ in 2008 and had the same superb service. It's not what you pay it's who you fly with and Air NZ is in the very top shelf.	1
Travelled from Gatwick to Calgary with Air Transat. Paid extra for two seats at the back of plane (on their own with no seats adjoining them.). This was well worth the extra money. Cabin crew were very pleasant both going and coming back. Would definitely travel with Air Transat again.	1
Great flight from London to Paris. Brand new Boeing 787 aircraft with the very comfortable and beautiful new cabin from Air France. Very short flight (only 45 mins) so the friendly flight attendant only served a croissant and hot beverages. The flight departed on time and the journey was very pleasant. Will definitely fly again with Air France.	1
Paris to Rome. I have recently been flying with Air France in Europe on a relatively regular basis, and I am so far very satisfied of the service offered. On my recent flight from Paris to Rome I was offered complimentary newspaper in the terminal waiting area, a wet serviette upon boarding and a sandwich, wine and tea/coffee during the flight. The crew spoke French, Italian and English and the captain was very talkative and mentioned cities and sights we overflew. All in all, a very friendly crew and a pleasant flight compared to the usual dreary experience in European short-haul economy.	1
We flew Business Class from Auckland to Hong Kong and was a wonderful experience. I have recently flown long-haul Business on Cathay and Emirates and the Air NZ lie-flat bed is far better then anything else I have seen. Food was great.	1
We upgraded to club class because of the extra legroom in the seats. We did not expect much as it was cheaper than Air Canada. We were in for a surprise! We flew from Toronto to Puerto Vallarta Mexico. As soon as we were seated we were offered a glass of wine. We had two cabin flight attendants for the business class. The flight attendants were very cheerful and helpful throughout the flight the food was the best we've had on any aircraft. Wrote the flight we were offered wine beer liquor the cure coffee tea anything that we wanted. The nicest part about it is there is a separate washroom for only the business class. We were hoping that the service and food would be as good on the way home. And it was. I would not hesitate to fly Air Transat again.	1
AKL to SFO 777 300ER. Great flight with a very friendly and efficient cabin crew. Food was extremely good and nicely presented. Aircraft was fairly new clean with comfortable flat beds. A very enjoyable flight. This was a vastly better experience than our next leg with British Airways.	1
YVR to AKL 777-200ER. Another excellent flight with Air New Zealand. The cabin crew were great and made the flight very enjoyable. Food was great and nicely presented. The aircraft was fairly old but was clean and everything worked as it should. The entertainment system could do with an upgrade to content performance and display quality. The Air Canada Maple Leaf Lounge at Vancouver that Air New Zealand uses is quite poor.	1
I was on Flight 791 from Auckland to Adelaide it left at 8am on the 9th September the cabin crew were exceptional in their help to me and my partner she had a pinched nerve in her spine and they were brilliant in their attitude. I will always fly New Zealand in the future.	1
Over the past few months I have done long haul return flights in Premium Economy on Qantas Cathay and British Airways and Business Class on Singapore Airlines. I was flying from Sydney to San Francisco (via Auckland and LA) and the flight segment yesterday in Air New Zealand Premium Economy (space seats) from Auckland to Los Angeles was vastly better than all the other airline's Premium Economy. The seats are wonderfully designed spacious and comfortable with ample surrounding space. I loved the large pillow and even got a second one for extra comfort. In fact (even though the seats don't lie flat) the whole premium economy cabin with mood lighting and great layout looked better than the business class cabin. The toilet area was huge always spotless and I loved the whimsical 'bookcase'! The amenity pack was welcome with Clarins creams and cute stripy socks and eye mask with funny message on it. The entertainment selection (with noise cancelling headphones) was huge - really something for everyone - and a big screen with multiple angles for comfortable viewing. The service from 2 male flight attendants was outstanding and the meals were absolutely delicious by any (not just airline) standard. I think the food is the same as in Business Class - for dinner I had figs olives and proscuiito as a starter salmon in a crust with bean puree and spinach lemon tart camomile tea and chocolates (with sparkling wine and NZ Shiraz) breakfast was muesli with yoghurt cheese and mushroom omelette with tomato concasse coffee etc. I have often flown business and first class on other airlines - I can honestly say that if I could fly to all the destination I need to go on Air NZ Premium Economy (space seats) it would always be my first choice. A superb product.	1
Super convenient 3 pm departure from Delhi. Only direct flight from Delhi to Madrid. Excellent legroom in Economy class - more than any other long-haul airline I have been on. Adequate film choices in English. Decent meal, wholesome snack - more substantive than ANA which I flew to Tokyo from Delhi last month. Absolutely nothing wrong in traveling this airline. Asked for a Gin and tonic, got two without asking. Just don't understand why people criticize this airline so much. It's my preferred choice in Economy when possible.	1
Mumbai to Delhi on Air India. I had taken this afternoon flight on an Airbus A321 after checking in online prior to the flight. Had dropped off my baggage at the designated drop off point and proceeded towards the boarding gate. The flight crew on this flight were quite polite and professional. Even though the departure time was 1pm, we had left around 1.15 or so. After departure, lunch service had commenced and as this was a domestic flight, Air India serves only vegetarian options and so had a meal of paneer masala and rice with dal. For dessert a sweet dish of barfi was provided. The food was excellent. After lunch, tea was served. This flight had an occupancy of around 85% and we reached our destination 10 minutes ahead of schedule. All in all, it was an excellent flight and I would fly with them again.	1
Cabin crew took care of me from Prague to Paris CDG and they were speaking very well English. Gate agent has kindly provided me my luggage tag number. I would probably continue to fly with Air France. Next trip will be through Amsterdam to Bordeaux and I hope it will be fine. I've never been there but I'm optimistic. Recommendation: I will definitely appreciate if they can change the coffee offered on board.	1
Departed Jan 26 2014 for Antigua - good flight and de-iced the plane prior to take off. Returned Feb 2 2014 to Toronto - good flight - thanks to the pilots/catering in Toronto on strike - Air Transat was very considerate and gave travelers a $15 voucher to buy food at Antigua airport. Very considerate and thoughtful. Air Transat Rep greeted us at the airport. She was polite/professional. She was at Antigua airport to inform us of the hour delay food vouchers and was always informative.	1
London to Mumbai. The check in process was quite smooth and as I had already checked in to the flight via the mobile app, all that was left was to print the boarding passes and baggage tags and deposit baggage. The departure time of the flight was 13:15 however the flight departed after a delay of 45 mins. The inflight service was top notch. After an hour or so, flight attendants served drinks (eg. orange juice, water, whiskey) and peanuts. I opted for the non veg option for lunch which was lamb curry with rice along with salad, a bun and kheer for dessert. The food was excellent. The IFE entertainment had a good collection of movies (Hollywood/ Bollywood) and TV shows. Before landing, a second hot meal service where for non veg, malai chicken along with veg hara bhara kebab and pattice was given along with a bun, fruits and a gulab jamun for dessert. We arrived at Mumbai at around 3am and proceeded to collect baggage without any problems. All in all, a good solid flight with nice friendly crew, good cabin atmosphere, ambience, good IFE content, good food to eat.	1
Air France was absolutely splendid. Flew from Vancouver to Munich via Paris. We had no issues, they made this long travel time a breeze. The food was great, seats were comfortable. Moreover, when anxiety got the best of me due to an airport issue in Paris, the Air France ladies took me in and took care of me until I was able to calm down. It helped my panic attack immensely and at that point they did not even known that we were flying with them. Offered us seats and water etc. Cannot thank them enough.	1
This was my first time flying Air France long haul. Everything (absolutely everything) went above my expectations for my flight from Hong Kong to Kiev via Paris CDG. I'm a very frequent traveler, so I know what to expect, but again, they pleasantly surprised me at every stage of travel. I don't review the booking process as I booked at klm.com where everything worked fine. The small issue was when buying online a la carte meal option (didn't work in Safari browser) I had to make in Chrome. Then I had trouble with paid seat option: seat of my choice disappeared from my booking. Contacted them via Facebook and got it done in 30 minutes. Perfect! In town check in in Hong Kong worked fine. At the airport boarding was done in perfect order. On the plane, I found seating quite satisfactory despite it being 10 in row (I booked Duo set at the back). Padding was comfortable, and recline was enough to seat in relaxed position (I'm 186 cm tall). Entertainment options were amazing with lots of documentary and arthouse. Dining was fine. My a la carte order was delivered without noticing. All the crew were nice and very effective despite full flight and lots of Chinese customers who required lot of translation services. Toilets kept clean and stocked. Cabin had fresh look and didn't feel claustrophobic even with such a tight layout. Breakfast served was good. Departure and arrival on time. My bag made the connection. No problem with transfer within CDG 2E from gates L to gates K by train via fast security search. My next flight to Kiev was bang on time. European flight seating comfort is only good when you purchase exit row seat. Otherwise it is not good even in business cabin. Food was good again with full bar service. I do recommend them highly for long haul travel. For short flights I recommend allow at least 3 hrs for smooth transfer at CDG and exit row seating only.	1
AKL to Apia return on NZ 992/991 for a four day trip travelling only with hand luggage. Web checked the first flight and went straight to lounge prior to boarding. Lounge busy but kept clear of passengers used dishes. Good selection of food available lounge attendants efficient as was the barista in making me a great macchiato! Flights themselves were generally excellent. Crew friendly and efficient both ways. Not much to say about return flight as leaves Apia at 0150hrs arriving 0500hrs but had a whole row to stretch out in to sleep. Early arrival home and outside terminal in 10 minutes after landing. Excellent value for money. Look forward to me next trip.	1
Mumbai to London on Boeing 787. The legroom is quite spacious and flight attendants were polite and professional. For breakfast I opted for the non-veg option which was omlette with chicken sausage and potatoes, croissant, fruit salad, bun and tea. The breakfast was very tasty. Upon waking up, a second round of food and drinks service started and watched a Hollywood movie. The non veg option contained chicken and rajma with rice, salad and gulab jamun. Before arrival, immigration forms were handed out. The flight attendants went about their tasks efficiently even though they may have been stiff on certain occasions. I would recommend this airline on this sector.	1
London Heathrow to Newark. Got to the gate 1 hour and 30 min before takeoff instead of going to all the star alliance lounges. Mistake, you can probably arrive 45 min before takeoff despite what you're boarding pass says. Boarded the plane and we sat there with the In-Flight Entertainment not working for an hour and a half. We had to remind the flight attendant to turn it on. The screen though is massive, and there is a wide variety of movies in HD in English and Indian. This is probably because of their new 787 Dreamliner which is very nice. The seats recline a lot and the windows are all tinted blue the whole flight so the plane isn't to bright. We got served a Indian lamb or chicken dish. Very authentic Indian food along with very nice Indian flight attendants. IFE stayed on the whole flight and they server a breakfast of chicken and falafel which was very good. Landed very smoothly with 40 mph cross winds. Impressive food, service, and comfort from Air India.	1
Singapore to Toulouse via Paris. We booked our yearly flight to France through Air France this requiring Singapore Airlines to take us on the first leg from Perth to Singapore. As we left the Singapore flight we were met at the aircraft door and taken in a motorised vehicle from Terminal 3 to Terminal 1 to board the Air France flight. We were taken to the First Class Lounge and when boarding was to take place we were again driven to the gate lounge where we were escorted to the front of the security queue. We quickly cleared security and were escorted to our seats 1E/F. The service we received on board was better than we have ever received with any other airline. The seat transformed into a wide and long full flat very comfortable bed. On reaching Paris (DG we left the plane and were guided via a secured doorway to a waiting limousine whereupon we passed through "private" security and immigration. We were the only people there - this process taking about 3 minutes. After being escorted to the First Class lounge where we waited we were picked up by limousine just before take-off of the Toulouse flight and driven to the waiting aircraft - again bypassing all the queues. What we appreciated more than anything else was being expertly guided through all the airports and at each stage being advised that our checked in bags had been located and were confirmed as being on the flight with us (a relief because we have previously lost bags on other airlines). We don't particularly like Airports and flying but if you have to do it, this Air France experience well exceeded our expectations - absolutely superb!	1
Recently had to be diverted from Queenstown to Christchurch due to extremely high winds trying to land in Queenstown. Once in Christchurch Air New Zealand staff were excellent they arranged and paid for accommodation the shuttle to get to the hotel and breakfast the following morning. They then notified us at our hotels about our flight that had been arranged the following day and then collected us all by shuttle to get us back to the airport on time. We had a smooth flight into Queenstown the following day. The situation was handled extremely well.	1
Flew AKL-LAX-LHR and back 30th June out 14th July return. I had a seat each for me and my two kids both under 5. All of the crews were fantastic with them going out of their way to assure our comfort. The crew as we approached LHR were exceptional and took the initiative of laying on a "Meet & Assist" at LHR which was such a help and a great touch. Check in at AKL was brilliant abysmal at LHR but that was the only down point of an otherwise excellent trip. Kids loved the most of the food though spaghetti is a tough one to feed a toddler on a plane! Didn't get a chance to test the TV I grabbed sleep when the kids slept!	1
We had an excellent experience with Air Transat - like others on this forum we were a little concerned about some of the problems experienced but we have nothing but good things to say about them. Both flights were on time the planes were recently refurbished and the staff were excellent good humored and ready to help with any request. We had seat back entertainment on the way home which was the best touch screen system I have used on a plane and makes others look clunky. A staff member at Toronto airport went above and beyond the call of duty when she got us onto our return flight when we'd been delayed by Toronto traffic - we shouldn't really have made it on but her determination saved us hundreds of pounds we'd have incurred for booking a one way flight back to the UK. Would definitely fly with them again.	1
I flew one way from London Gatwick to Toronto in October 2013. The reason for choosing Air Transat was simply cost - other airlines are not interested in selling one-way fares. Only Air Transat and Icelandair offer reasonable prices for one-way trips and only Air Transat is non-stop. Both Air Canada and British Airways wanted about $1900 from London Heathrow to Toronto whereas Air Transat (from Gatwick) was under $500. The check-in agent at Gatwick was rude but she was the only employee I could possibly say anything negative about and since all other staff went out of their way to be positive I will just ignore this one bad apple. The flight attendants were all very friendly and helpful as were the people at the gate. The flight left and arrived on time to the minute. Food was - well let's just say no worse than any other airline. I think the legroom was a bit better than some others. My luggage was on the carousel by the time I got through immigration. There truly is nothing to complain about. The particular plane that I was on did not have seat-back video but instead had the older style screens with their choice of movies. I brought a book to read so did not really even watch this. Really with all the negative experiences I have become accustomed to when flying I must say that this flight (my first flight with Air Transat) was a rare positive.	1
I flew Air Transat mid-August 2013 to August 31 2013 for a tour of Italy. I pre-ordered my seats in order to book a window and 2-seater. I found the leg room to be very roomy. They had mood lighting in the aircraft which was very nice. On the flight from Toronto to Rome I was looking forward to individual TV monitors but there was a change with the aircraft and we had a big screen at the centre of the aircraft. Fortunately returning from Rome to Toronto we did have TV's leg room and wonderful service. I would recommended.	1
My wife and I flew to Tonga from Auckland on 5th July 2014 and returned 12th July 2014 The aircraft used on both sectors was a 19 year old 767-300. The aircraft was in pretty good order considering it's age. Departure pretty well on time. Friendly staff. Idiotic Bear Grylls safety video. Reasonable selection of audio video. Food awful vegetable frittata Air NZ has been serving for some time now. Return food much better - beef salad or butter chicken. One water round on each flight. "Kia Ora" Inflight magazine no longer in every seat back. No more than twelve copies available from magazine rack at forward cabin. Toilets clean and tidy. This is the only airline surfacing Tonga from Auckland. Good flights both ways.	1
I flew AKL-LAX on 24 June NZ2 returning LAX-AKL on 1 July on NZ5. I was in Business Class both ways. The service and attention to detail is exemplary. Even in the middle of the night pushing the call button got immediate attention. The food both ways was exceptional and it was always nice to be asked if I would like some more or is their anything else I can get you. In these days of cost cutting in service and staff on tight contracts Air NZ staff really do go that extra mile and really do look like they enjoy their jobs. The flights arrived early both ends which is always welcomed the pilots very rarely get the recognition they deserve in these surveys.	1
Traveled from Gatwick on 8th Sep to Calgary and back on 29th September. On both flights my wife needed wheelchair assistance the whole service was excellent. We booked rear seats in option plus which was worth every penny. The seats were very comfortable on both flights staff very cheerful and helpful good food with all the extras of option plus. Both flights were on the upgraded planes with individual entertainment in the back of each seat which was good. All in all I would recommend this Airline to anyone compared to others we have traveled on to Canada. I would most certainly book with them again.	1
I flew London Heathrow to Paris Charles de Gaulle with Air France on the new Boeing 787. This aircraft is being used on one of the daily rotations between the cities. We left 20 minutes late but arrived on time. Full IFE, which I did not use for this short trip. It's worth noting that unlike British Airways penny pinching, Air France still give hot drinks, water and a snack free. Crew very good.	1
My family and I flew from Los Angeles to Rarotonga and return June 15 June 28 Business class. The plane is an older 767-300. The only two possible things I could mention are (1) the seats are not very wide although adequate. (2) the inflight entertainment is somewhat dated. Thing is entertaining us is not what a good airline is all about; getting from point "A" to point "B" in a timely safe manner is and ANZ is a good airline.	1
Calgary to London Gatwick and return. Everything was very smooth efficient and pleasant on both fights from check-in to in-flight service and getting our baggage. The flight to London was overnight and there weren't individual screens (3 out of 5 *) but they did play a movie or 2 and a show perhaps on the overhead monitors. I was trying to sleep so I didn't pay attention although I did notice the picture in the screens would jump/flicker regularly. The food was okay for airplane food and they were good with running the drink carts up and down regularly while still allowing quiet time for people to rest. The lighting overhead was really neat since it mimicked sunset and sunrise accordingly. The flight back to Calgary was daytime and there were individual seat back monitors which was awesome. Good selection of free tv shows movies even games and it worked flawlessly (5 out of 5*). I bought the ear buds on board with one of the packages available: the ear buds a snack (chocolate bar) and an alcohol beverage (Baileys) for $9 or $10. You could buy them separately for $3. Lunch wasn't fantastic taste-wise I had the chicken stir fry but it was still a meal and I'm not super picky. I do wish there was a little better selection of snacks - only caramilk or plain pringles but I should've remembered to buy snacks beforehand in the airport and I'm sure they're limited on space. Very friendly attendants on the flight to Calgary. We arrived almost 30 minutes early and it was a nice smooth flight. Baggage was already waiting on the carousel.	1
Manchester to Calgary and return on TS215/214 Club class. New upgraded cabin. Priority check-in and first to board the plane. Suitcases labeled priority and first off the carousel. The seating is excellent a decent amount of recline and lumbar support good legroom they aren't really meant for sleeping but do offer a good amount of rest. The staff couldn't be faulted attentive polite always ready to assist. The meals were of a very good quality presented on porcelain plates with metal cutlery with drinks to follow. The entertainment system had a touch screen with modern films TV progs music radio etc and could be paused at anytime. A travelling kit was also provided which included a blanket flight socks earphones blowup neck support earplugs eye mask etc. Overall I thought that the experience was worth what I paid and would do the same again I realise that everyone has a budget and it is expensive for the extras for the extra money paid this could be another weeks holiday to someone.	1
Flew Air France from London Heathrow to Cape Town via Paris. As an ex-cabin crew member of the 70's vintage, I am hypercritical of the service onboard which ever airline I travel with. I was most impressed with most aspects of the flight - my first with this airline. The senior cabin crew manager was charming and helpful in the extreme, moving me to a vacant seat that had much more legroom, and also offered me his personal gadget that enabled me to charge my iPad. The seat was just ok, however, as other reviewers have mentioned. The people who introduced this new seat should get James Dyson, the British vacuum designer, to have a look as it, as it is not comfortable. Plenty of pillows did help though. I am returning in Business Class, so will report on that in a couple of weeks time. Incidentally, the transit at CDG airport was seamless, and my suitcase was waiting for me on arrival. Well done Air France.	1
We flew Air New Zealand on our way to New York via Los Angeles return. We were impressed with the service friendliness and professionalism of the crew on all flights. They were immaculately presented and extremely helpful. This airline is in a league of its own.	1
Flight TS 535 July 26th Gatwick to Toronto and returned on flight TS222 August 13th Toronto to Gatwick. Staff very helpful and polite. Great comfortable flight. Wish Air Transat flew to other countries we would use them every time.	1
Flew to London August 20. Flew first class and it puts Air Canada to shame. So much cheaper and better amenities. Planes are modern inside and crew were enjoying their job. Service was excellent. Flights were $800 cheaper per person than competitors. Food was outstanding wine choices snacks and overall experience would make this my airline of choice. Seats very comfortable and pleasant.	1
First time with Air France flying from Paris CDG to Dubai. What a surprise. Everything went just perfectly. Boarding has been very fast. Seat was so comfortable that I managed to sleep although I can never sleep in Economy. Awesome variety of entertainment channels and movies. Food was excellent as the drinks. Flight attendants extremely courteous and professional. Clean toilets. Only one tiny negative remark. There was no WiFi on board this flight and I needed it for work.	1
My business partner and I flew Auckland/Queenstown on 20 May returning the next day. I don't normally comment on domestic flights but these two flights need recognition for the stellar service provided by Air New Zealand. It was two newish A320's either way and manned by some of the best staff I have encountered. We were Star Alliance Gold so had the options of seats in Row 1. Water tea/coffee and snacks were provided and a second cup was available for anyone that wanted. Well done Air New Zealand!	1
Mumbai to Amritsar via New Delhi with Air India. To my surprise it was a pleasant trip as I had been told that it was not a good option to fly on Air India. The food quality and taste was great, I was greeted very well, the leg space is good as I am above 6ft. The biggest problem I normally have flying is with the leg space but there was ample room on this flight.	1
Just flew from LAX to AKL on ANZ in business class. It is what business class should be like. Very attentive staff although the food is getting a bit downgraded and staff at the LAX lounge are just okay I think the majority of staff are now subcontractors so do not have the Kiwi values except for long term staff. Air NZ needs to be careful not to try and squeeze out too much profit yet is still offers one of the best business classes in the field. Just fly UAL from Sydney and see how they have not really upped their game. I wish they would match AirNZ.	1
Air Transat exceeded my expectations. The service was much friendlier and more enjoyable then most non-charter airlines. On our return from Amsterdam after upgrading we were upgraded again to Club Class and everything from the ipad style entertainment to the food and the service was exceptional. When we couldn't land in Toronto because of the infamous rain storm the pilots and staff provided safe comfortable and informative service and maintained their good humour. Not easy to do with a plane full of people moaning about the closed airport.	1
Took the Option Plus with emergency exit seats. Would recommend exit seats in the middle of the plane not the 3 towards the window as every time I fell asleep someone would fall over my feet. Option Plus was really convenient especially the speedy check in however I would rather pay a bit more and go for Club Class. Service was probably the best service I have seen in years. They constantly have a smile on their face and after a chat with one of the flight attendants it seems that they actually like their job. Food was the typical Airline food - had worse had better. Both flights reached their destination ahead schedule and the planes were clean and had a personal TV at each seat.	1
Flight NZ 8046 Christchurch to Wellington 19 March 2014. Our flight yesterday went beyond just "good service" it was excellent service. This is not necessarily because anything out of the ordinary happened on our flight but rather because our Air New Zealand pilots and cabin attendant just did the ordinary things particularly well. No fuss no bother just professionalism. We felt comfortable happy and safe and when it is all said and done that's why one chooses to fly with a particular airline.	1
I flew from SFO to Auckland. The entertainment system is phenomenal. I did not run out of movies to choose from the whole plane ride was not enough for me to watch all the movies available unlike the other airlines with limited movies. Other airlines like United charges for entertainment access (ridiculous). The food is filling and the unlimited wine helped. The seats are very comfy with plenty of leg room the only problem is getting out when the people seating in front of you all have their seats reclined it gets pretty tricky. Nevertheless I will certainly chose Air New Zealand again if given the chance.	1
Never having been on a long haul flight before I was dreading the experience especially having read some derogatory reviews. I was delighted with the plane the staff the food and the entertainment. My first long haul from Glasgow to Calgary and then return from Vancouver were faultless and I would not hesitate to travel Air Transat again.	1
We flew MEL-LAX return in Business Premier on 3rd Dec returning 19th Jan. Although our 5th trip with Air NZ this was our first time travelling Business. I was impressed from the moment we were on the plane we were warmly greeted by the hostess and whilst getting settled were offered a pre-take off drink whilst the other passengers were boarding. At this time they also take an order for your pre-dinner drink to be served once cruising altitude is reached. Drinks and Food came out promptly and was of a high quality impressed that we were not presented with standard airline food. The lie flat beds were comfortable enough to get a few hours sleep on the long flight and definitely worth the extra money we spent. Entertainment system provided plenty of choice to suit a range of tastes making the trip going very fast. We had the same positive experience on our flight home and cannot praise Air NZ enough for such an enjoyable journey.	1
My wife and I travelled return from Toronto to Gatwick London. Left on 4 Juen 2013 returned 16/06/13. We were very pleased with the flights and service. The seats were a bit cramped but satisfactory for the journey. The food was good enough and the service excellent. Nice  pleasant cabin crew. Check in was fast and efficient friendly counter staff at Gatwick. Planes were in good condition and have a very pleasing interior. We would definitely fly Air Transat again.	1
SYD-AKL-LAX and LAX-AKL-SYD. Consistently warm helpful and willing staff. Excellent product on the 777 with the thicker mattress on the bed (compared with Virgin Atlantic) and restaurant quality food and wine selection. Toilets are extremely small but there is a disabled one available in premium economy. Overall excellent interaction despite missed connection due to another carrier. Overall I would always choose to fly with AirNZ if possible. Unfortunately let down by their alliance with United who are the antithesis of everything AirNZ is. Would love them to have wider seats in Business on 767 as I choose to travel in business due to size and not to disturb or impede people next to me if I flew in economy. The 767 seat is my least favourite aspect of the experience.	1
Flew with my business partner AKL-LAX-AKL in Premium Economy on 777-300. Boarding was stress free both sides as we were Premium Economy plus Star Alliance Gold and Koru members so either way we were first on the plane. The flight attendants were available and were there to help right from the start with overhead locker storage etc. Main meals were delivered shortly after take off both ends and the quality of the meals were very similar if not the same to what I've had in business class with each course brought out separately. Quality of the alcohol was good plus it was nice to have a good mug of tea coffee and after dinner mints afterwards. Amenity Packs were the same as in business class. The seat is multi adjustable and obviously nowhere near lie flat but after some adjustment got a nice sleeping position. The seat and footwells accommodated my 6 foot 2 inch frame my only criticism was the footwell that narrows wouldn't accommodate my size 12’s so take your shoes off and rest your feet on the bean bag supplied. The crew both ways were excellent. The quality of service was excellent. The seats being pod design mean your personal space is not encroached on I am disappointed to hear that Premium Economy seating on their Dreamliner or the 777-200 upgrades will not be using this type of seating.	1
My wife and I traveled on 2 transpacific flights (ANZ 01 ANZ 06) recently and arrived at LAX 2 days before the Friday Nov 1 bombing. These flights and two others from and to Melbourne were the most comfortable international flights we've ever taken and we started flying internationally in 1968. We'd recommend Air New Zealand. Auckland International Airport was also superb though I speak less enthusiastically about Melbourne. My only negative is why does ANZ continue to use LAX? That airport was a total mess and the pits before the recent shootings. Its (among other US airports - DTW for example) a national disgrace. Can't you fly into something close in LA and skip LAX?	1
Flew Club class Manchester to Toronto. Difficult to fault. Smooth instant check in comfortable seat with plenty of room and pleasant flight staff. Food was plentiful and good as we're the drinks. Only niggle was that there was no choice of meal as only one was left by the time we were served. Didn't really matter as what we got was good. Landed on time and luggage first off as promised. I recommend this airline without hesitation if choosing club class.	1
We travelled NZ1 LHR to AKL on 13 October and had a wonderful flight with great service from a dedicated cabin crew on both legs. Our issue is that a traveller was allowed to fly with bare feet in sandals which he took off on boarding. This is the second time we've encountered this on an Air New Zealand Business class flight I was sitting in 4A and this person was in 5B with his dirty feet on the ottoman in front of my view the whole way. Thankfully he got off in LA. As I said this is the second time this has happened to me and I think it's horrible.	1
NZ1 on 13/10/2013 NZ2 on 21/10/2013. Best airline experience from LHR-LAX. Amazing service really comfortable proper bed super food and a great crew. Faultless service. Can definitely recommend business class.	1
I flew with Air France from Istanbul to London via Paris. All cabin crews were friendly and professional, brand new aircraft with very comfortable seats and the food was great and copious (compared to other airlines). I will recommend and fly with Air France again.	1
Had a great trip MEL-AKL-LAX. The food and service were first class on full planes. This is the best way to judge an airline and New Zealand kept up the service all the way. The planes were all on time and I was impressed with the economy section meals. I needed an aisle seat and the staff went out of their way to get the seat for me. The inflight entertainment was second to none and the planes modern and comfortable.	1
Big difference between Club and economy. Club does not cost much and it is really similar to premium economy on other airlines but it really is worth it. This was on an aged 310 from Manchester to Toronto. We could not get club on the outward leg but did for the return. Huge difference in comfort and attention: the upgrade was only some £97 each! I am 6'2 and was very uncomfortable on the back: very comfortable in the front given the extra baggage food drink and good service the upgrade is tremendous value.	1
I took a flight from Dublin to Toronto with Air Transat over the summer. This is my fourth year in a row with the company and they never fail to disappoint. Staff are friendly and the aircraft spotless. Definitely value for money.	1
I travelled from LHR via LAX to New Zealand on 10 Sep 2013 and returned to LHR the same way on 3 Oct 2013. I cannot praise Air New Zealand's service highly enough. Everything was perfect and in my opinion could not be faulted. A wonderful airline!	1
Havana to Paris CDG has got to be one of the best long haul flights my husband and I have been on. The comfort of the Business seats/beds and service far surpassed British Airways and Virgin. The cabin staff working our cabin were very friendly and attentive and the presentation excellent. The food was delicious and well presented and accompanying wines the best. We flew Air France the day before Heathrow/CDG. We arrived ok but our baggage did not arrive. Thanks to staff in the baggage office in the arrivals hall it was located and sent to our hotel within a few hours. 	1
Wonderful service accommodation and staff throughout my journey from LAX-AKL. The VIP lounges are excellent and well stocked and the Premier Business class seats are the best lay flat seats I've travelled in. Wonderful meals and wine selections too! Koru Club in AKL is huge and has plenty of room to stretch out and drink/eat.	1
Bogota to Paris CDG. Great experience with Air France, who upgraded us, premium economy seats are very confortable. Flight arrived on time despite a late departure. In my opinion, Air France offers the best service among the major European airlines.	1
Paris to Fort-de-France. Now that Air France have fully renovated their Boeing 777 fleet, all we can say is that it is absolutely perfect! We were warmly greeted at the airport and taken care of rapidly; we even got upgraded from economy to Premium economy. We were running late but the hostess took charge of us to make sure that we did not miss the flight. Once onboard, we were given refreshements, snacks and a large amenity kit for the whole flight which I still keep at home. Everything in the cabin was immaculate. The ambient lighting, cosy seats and the friendly staff were the main ingredients for this wonderful flight. In fact, when we went past the economy, which seemed actually quite comfy and had large IFE displays, we arrived to our seats.  This premium economy featured really large IFE screens with so much entertainment for everyone's tastes and reclinable seats which reclined nearly 60 degrees without disturbing the person behind you. The food was really tasty and great for plane food, and defintely wasn't expecting to be served truffle spaghetti on top of sirloin steak! Ultimately, the flight was great.	1
Travelled to Toronto club class on A310 from Glasgow in June. Check in priority boarding and all services on board were excellent. Pre-ordered meals were what I ordered as was cabin service with friendly staff. Seating was comfortable with plenty of leg room. Can't wait to try new cabin in the future.	1
I was travelling from Porto Seguro to Paris, and owing to a booking error I ended up at Sao Paulo Congonhas. My time was short, I got a taxi at great haste to Sao Paulo Guarulhos, on arrival an attendant told me it was closed, I showed him my ticket, he said come. I followed him up 2 floors and into an office where a very helpful lady listened to my brief dilemma, she immediately checked my passport, made call and then at breakneck speed took me quite a way to the plane which was ready to depart.  I got on as the doors closed, I want to give my utmost praise to the wonderful staff of Air France, and on that night Mar 2nd to that so helpful staff of Air France for enabling me against all the odds to catch my flight. My flight to Paris was wonderful, beautiful food rest, attention.	1
We took NZ2 Auckland-LAX-LHR and 3 weeks later NZ 288 Shanghai-Auckland. Everything was excellent: great landings food and inflight entertainment.	1
My family and I flew Air New Zealand from Los Angeles CA to and from Rarotonga Cook Islands. The plane was a spacious B767 and the flight was overall "lovely". The 9 plus hours were made bearable by the service friendly staff and great airplane. Everything worked well (screens etc) and the attendants even came by in the middle of the night offering water to awake passengers. Definitely a "do again" airline for us!	1
BCN to YUL. I did not expect such a high level service from this airline after former experience. It was a real surprise. The director of the flight and all staff were friendly and attentive. The seat was comfortable with excellent leg room the food was nice and the selection of drinks was good and frequent. There were some problems with the entertainment system and a passenger who commented it to FA later was asked if a compensation can be offered to her. Very good value for money and a pleasant experience.	1
Toronto to Antananarivo via Paris. Two tiny complaints. Air France Lounge in Antananarivo Airport warmer than I'd like. And cut back on the smoked salmon with the appetizers (I like it but it was seemingly with ever meal or snack). Otherwise brilliant. From boarding in Toronto to quick debarkation back in Toronto (and luggage already there after clearing customs!!) all went great. Nice attentive staff throughout, great lounge at CDG (showers with towels and toiletries all provided great perk before and after the 12 hr flight to and from Antananarivo), and just a fab experience with AF (my first). CDG a wonderful airport. Antananarivo  not so much, though it functions, with incessant checking of papers and your carry on (even after screening your bags were checked on the tarmac and you were wanded as well). Old style business bucket seats seem to draw some complaints - they work fine, even for this 220 pound 6/1 male.	1
NZ176 PER-AKL. Wasn't planning on flying into NZ with ANZ but missed connections meant we were put on this flight. Staff very friendly and helpful. Food very nice especially dessert. Didn't put seat into bed mode when offered (stewards help change it from seat to bed) but just reclined it as far as it would go. Liked how table didn't come out of seat (for a change!) and was a fairly decent size too.	1
Flight: In last 2-3 months. I fly Air Transat to Ireland or England at least twice a year. I always fly Club Class and find that it is well worth the extra cost. Club Class allows you special check in and your baggage comes out first at your destination. The Club Class cost is not much more than regular Economy in most other airlines but should not be mistaken for First Class or Business Class in other airlines. Some passengers seem to believe that the additional fare should give them much more than it actually does. Crew members are always pleasant and the service is very good. The food could be a bit better (Menu hasn't changed in at least 4 years) and movies could be a bit more recent but other than that I have no complaints. The best part is there are very rarely any delays so that is better than most other carriers.	1
Paris to Tokyo Haneda with Air France. Boarded the aircraft on time and were greeted by friendly cabin crew. I selected one of the seats at the rear of the aircraft so there was a lot of freedom in terms of movement. The seats were not so bad. Basic comfort amenities were provided. The food was great, and the customer service from cabin crew too. Entertainment was very good - a good selection of mainstream and international movies. The flight was very smooth, I felt rested when we arrived. I will definitely fly with Air France again.	1
Travelled LHR-LAX-LHR. Boeing 777-300. 22nd June out and 7th July back. Great flight in PE 24 A. FAs very good food excellent service all round would defiantly recommend especially over Virgin on this route.	1
Atlanta to Malaga via Washington and Paris CDG with Air France, and absolutely perfect service. Plane, food, items given to customers, and service from flight attendants exceptional. The pilot searched out the children on the plane to give them pins and holograms before flight. The children were given their special and organic meals before adults, which allowed me to comfortably feed them before receiving my tray. They included special "airplane" utensils to eat with, and each was given a special pencil case which included an activity book, colored pencils, and more. Well done, I highly recommend making an effort to fly Air France.	1
BNE to Vancouver and return Business Class - have travelled on many airlines over the years and found Air New Zealand to be one of the best. Inflight service was excellent and the lie flat seats were comfortable. My husband is rather tall with broad shoulders he found he could even turn over and slept well. Flights left on time and check in quick and with a smile. Well done Air New Zealand. Will recommend.	1
15th May LAX-AKL. I have been flying for many years and to this date Air New Zealand is by far the best Airline I have flown with. I have nothing to complain about. The staff were exceptional! Comfy seat with foot rest makes a lot of difference. Very generous inflight entertainment good food and very clean bathrooms. Unfortunately on my return from NZ I had to fly with United who are affiliated with Air New Zealand. Flying with United was very uncomfortable. There is no comparison at all.	1
Very satisfactory flight March 31 LA to Auckland. Especially nice as plane not full and flight staff moved us around to have max. room for long flight. Flight 28/4/13 2 of staff in our area were very friendly attentive and gave excellent service.	1
I flew Auckland - LAX on 6 May and return 26 May. First flight was on 777-200 which was looking pretty tired but that's about the only criticism I have. Service food entertainment crew and seats in business premier all to a very high standard. Return leg was on a 777-300 and although similar had a much fresher cabin a bigger touch screen TV and a really good thick mattress which they put over the bed plus two decent sized pillows. As seats they are nothing special with very limited settings but as a bed they are superb - fully flat plenty long enough and much wider across the shoulder which makes a huge difference compared to say Qantas where you feel you are in a slim fit coffin with not enough room to turn over. Crew were friendly and professional on both flights very generous with beverages and food of a very good quality not a huge selection but that's a minor gripe.	1
LAX to LHR. Left on May 20th and returned on June 5th. I go out of my way to fly Air New Zealand especially on long flights. First class service in economy great food and champagne can be ordered at no charge at any time friendly staff. You are in good hands with this airline.	1
Tokyo Haneda to Paris CDG and my first time to enjoy the new Air France La Premiere cabin. It is an incredible improvement versus the old first class cabin. The seat is very spacious and large. The quality of the dishes, wines and food were just outstanding The bed with the new Sofitel pillow is so confortable, I slept 9 hours. The curtain offers an elegant privacy for sleep. A clear recommandation to try this Air France first class.	1
Travelled Auckland to Port Vila this last weekend. For such a short hop to Vanuatu all aspects of the flight were excellent. As this trip was for a long weekend travelled with hand luggage only. Crew on both sectors warm and welcoming not to mention hardworking.	1
