Terrible customer service, rude and unhelpful. Flew Dublin to New York (Aer Lingus) and New York onto Las Vegas (jetblue) on 2 July. Bags never left Dublin until the 10 July and never received any bag for entire holiday. Supposedly bag arrived in Las Vegas sometime after this. On return to Dublin tried to trace bag whereabouts and was told by Aer Lingus that despite their mistake they would take no responsibility for the bag or helping find it and that it was jet blues issue, in saying this they were incredibly rude and unhelpful. Jet blue have then said they returned the bag from Las Vegas to Aer Lingus and said contact them to return it to Ireland. Now Aer Lingus refuse to say anything other then contact jetblue, but jetblue saying Aer Lingus have the bag! This is going on for 2 months and the time and money gone into trying to get bag back, nothing about the ruined holiday or the cost of additional clothing on holiday. At least jetblue try to help and have good customer service. Aer Lingus are just so rude and unhelpful and it was their mistake! Never flying with them again.	0
Chicago to Amsterdam via Dublin. My flight was cancelled and staff handled it very poorly, no one received anything. They gave us a sheet of paper with the wrong number/number that didn't exist. After asking around and searching their website we had to call a phone line that took 4+ hours to talk to someone and had a choice between rescheduling the next flight with them which was two days out or refund of the cancelled flight which means you have to pay expensive last minute flights with other airlines.	0
Air Berlin business class from Los Angeles to Berlin in May 2014. The first thing I noticed about Air Berlin business class: It's cramped. Very cramped. Air Berlin tries to sell the head-high dividers between its business class seats as "even more privacy" "even more isolation" and so on but in reality these are just flimsy plastic screens that fail to disguise the fact that Air Berlin has taken away about half the width of a "normal" business class seat and inserted another seat which is recessed so the other passenger's feet are sticking into your space. They manage to cleverly disguise this in their advertising by depicting only isolated seat units. In Air Berlin business class the feet of the person in the recessed seat next to you are a few inches away separated by a flimsy shaky plastic screen cutting into your space. The person in front of you is also recessed with their head sticking into your space. Air Berlin's plastic seat divider is - inexplicably - cut low in the back with the effect of exposing the top of your head if lower your back rest. If you recline and the person "behind you" (remember they're only half-way recessed) doesn't they're breathing on your scalp. If the person behind you coughs a lot - as happened to me - you're either coughed on the head a lot or you simply can't recline. This is exactly the kind of annoyance one pays to avoid in business class. In addition to significantly reduced width the seats are very short. I'm 185cms (6'1") and I could only "lie down" with my knees pulled up toward my chest. On my right the armrest was about four inches thick. On my left it was exactly the width of my index finger (not an exaggeration) and it was squeaky and wobbly (hard to believe but true). The in-flight entertainment is good with a solid noise-cancelling headset provided. The 15" screen is decent and operated via a remote with a mouse-like controller that works reasonably well but which your mother will not learn to use in a 100 years. The entertainment selection is limited. There were a few new movies but most of the selection was old stuff. There is a power outlet and a USB outlet. Storage is a problem. There is a compartment with cheap carpeting under the ottoman a pouch for magazines and rather small overhead compartments. Except for the medium-sized table there are no surfaces. Every business class passenger has - a few inches from their face - a strange UFO-looking contraption that turns out to be a combination of reading light and "night light." One can't help thinking this must be a case of designers gone insane. These units are unnecessary because there already is a reading light in the ceiling and ugly and cheap-looking producing the palest "night light" you could imagine. The food is pretty bad. Decent alcoholic beverages and snacks are available at any time. The flight attendants try pretty hard but they can't make up for the failings and cheapness of the cabin. They're nice but they'll throw you out of the kitchen immediately if you try to get up and stretch your legs a little. This shouldn't even be called "business class." It's more of a glorified economy class plus.	0
Phuket to Abu Dhabi. Most uncomfortable seat and with the smallest leg room I've ever experienced. Knees where wedged against the seat in front of me the entire flight and I'm only 5'11". They had to have the guy in front of me put his seat forward when serving the meals just to fit the food trays in. Entertainment and movie selection was laughable with nothing even remotely current. I know this is a low cost carrier but Ryanair is more comfortable that Air Berlin. Spend a few extra dirham and go with any other carrier than Air Berlin.	0
Flyer beware! I recently booked a flight through OneWorld Alliance-American Airlines. I received the confirmation email stating clearly a 2 baggage allowance. I arrived to the airport with an extra bag which I was prepared to pay for. The check in desk refused to acknowledge the baggage allowance in the confirmation email and preceded to charge my card for all the bags. The card was swiped several times as the agent said the charge would not go through. At this point I opted not to take the flight due to the excessive cost (550 Euro) and left with all my bags. I checked my account today only to discover that $412 USD has been taken from my account from AirBerlin. As I did not approve these charges I do not have a receipt. I attempted to call AirBerlin but was not able to get a human being on the phone.	0
Los Angeles to Bombay via Beijing. Worst airline ever. The flight from LAX  to Beijing on July 11th 2018 at 2:30 PM was cancelled and I was ordered to wait 24 hours for next flight and sent to a motel in LA. Later in the evening a customer service representative from Air China called me to say that they cannot book me for next day instead I have to wait for three more days due to complications with my connecting flight from Beijing to Bombay. She refused to cancel my ticket asking me to talk to my ticket agent. She also refused to confirm the flight cancellation (from LA to Beijing on 7/11/2018) and the website was showing the flight to be regular and not cancelled (although, all 300 passengers were accommodated in motels, etc.). My travel agent tried to contact several times but no air-china customer was taking the call even after 40 minutes wait on the phone. My electronic complaint to air china was responded with a web address/phone-number to talk to where no one picks up phone. I spent another $1000.00 to purchase a ticket through Delta airlines to go to Bombay. I am travelling internationally for over 35 years now and have traveled in many airlines. Based on the customer service, stone-walling any questions and for pure lying on their website and information centers, no one can beat air-china for the worst airline award. It is now four weeks I am trying to connect to someone there who would at least apologize but hey they don't consider anyone humans. My advise, better spend extra $100+ and book in one of the reliable airlines.	0
Stockholm to Manila via Beijing. Worst customer service ever! Would not recommend this airline and will I never fly with Air China again! - lost our baggage and nobody cared to search for it - six months later we have not recieved the compensation (although it has been promised to sent to us months ago) Every little move and step with them takes months. Nobody did not care to call back and check if baggage was recieved or not. I have never seen this bad customer service.. this is definitely a next level for a bad customer service!! If you want to save your time and nerve cells just don't choose Air China!	0
Montreal to Hong Kong via Beijing. Our flight from Montreal on May 19th departed at 4:00pm, 10 minutes earlier than the  departure time of 4:10pm. We had a connecting flight in Beijing on May 20th  at 6:30pm on flight and was supposed to be landing at 5:00pm however the plane only landed at 5:50 pm in Beijing. Due to this delay we missed our connecting flight to due the poor customer service from Air China at Beijing airport. When we arrived at the Beijing airport we were able to see that the were doing a last call however nothing was done to communicate to hold the plane for us and for other passengers that were supposed to be on that flight as well. This was the first time that we had flown with Air China and was the worst experience. We stayed in Beijing airport trying to figure out what to do until 9pm where we were told that we are getting a hotel to stay for the night with a meal included and will be catching a flight the next morning at 8am. We had taken a bus that brought us to a hotel which was the worst hotel ever in my life. Is this how you treat customers? We went into the restaurant hoping for a good meal after all of this terrible customer service and making us miss our flight. We were presented with a buffet that was the most disgusting food ever and with nothing to drink. Once we got into our room it smelled rotten and the bed was like sleeping on a piece of wood. The next day we went back to the airport to catch our flight and arrived in Hong Kong only to find out that one of our luggages is missing and that it was still in Beijing and the other luggage was damaged with one of the wheels broken which I had to purchase another luggage($150). We ended up getting the missing luggage delivered to us 12 hours later and found out that the luggage was damaged as well with the handle on the side ripped off. This is ridiculous and the customer service that Air China provides is way below standard and is a joke. On our way back from Japan on June 7th at Haneda airport, when checking in, we had asked for an upgrade to Premium economy for the flight CA879 from Beijing to Montreal and they agent had told us that the do not do upgrades and we would need to do it in Beijing when we catch our connecting flight. Once we got to gates in Beijing they told us that they do not do upgrades either. Customers looking to upgrade their seats and give Air China more money are turned down.  That being said, overall this is the worst experience I have ever witnessed from an airline.	0
I flew on Air Canada from Calgary to Las Vegas last December 28, 2018. I checked-in one luggage and had no carry on with me since it was a direct flight I didn't feel the need to bring a carry-on bag since all my things could fit in my checked-in luggage. I paid the baggage fee and checked-in earlier to make sure that I won't miss my flight. As soon as I passed through security I found out that my flight was delayed so I had no choice but to wait for another hour. That was tolerable and for whatever reason Air Canada would have I felt that I didn't need to make a big deal out of it. The worst part of my Air Canada experience was that upon Arrival in Las Vegas, I found out that my bag never made it to Las Vegas. I immediately went to the baggage claim office to file a report and they said that I would have to contact Air Canada so that they could trace my bag and send it to me. How the hell do you lose a luggage on a direct flight? Could you imagine how frustrating it was to be in a place where you literally had no clothes or any of your belongings with you for a 7 day trip? I have planned this vacation a long time ago and it was my only vacation for the year 2018. I have prepared a lot for this trip thinking that I would finally be able to relax and get my much needed rest. But I was wrong, Air Canada ruined my vacation because I mostly spent my time making a lot of phone calls, sending emails during the trip and what's worst is that I was only compensated for $200 which doesn't even compare or amount to the stress, hassle and huge inconvenience that they have caused me. They never really followed up anything with me during my whole vacation in Las Vegas. My luggage never arrived in Las Vegas. I had to literally buy everything in Vegas from underwear to toiletries. I had to always made time to just call them to check whether they have found my luggage. I never got the chance to give the presents that I have packed for my friends in Vegas. It was such a terrible and frustrating experience. As a frequent passenger of Air Canada I felt that this made me realize what kind of customer service Air Canada delivers in situations like this. Trust me, in case this happens to any of you, you can be assured that you will be getting the worst customer service. I never enjoyed my only vacation in Vegas in 2018 just because Air Canada failed to do their job and reassuring me that my luggage was safe and secured with them. If I never suggested the idea of calling the Calgary Airport to check whether my luggage is still there then I probably still don't have my luggage until now. There was no initiative on their part and their plan of action in reassuring their passengers that they will be able to track their luggage is very poor. It's sad to say that as I type this horrible experience from Air Canada, the $200 hasn't been paid. God knows when they will actually reply and take action on this. It's not even the money that I'm complaining about but its more on the amount of time that I wasted just to check the status of my luggage every now & then, the huge amount of stress thinking if I will ever find my luggage and my vacation plans were absolutely ruined just because everything that I needed for my trip was not with me all because of Air Canada's fault. How can you compensate all that? It's not like you can redo my vacation in Vegas all over again. The damage is done. I am so disappointed & frustrated with my experience with Air Canada. Never again.	0
I received an email 1 hour before the flight that the flight was canceled due to maintenance issues. They returned all the bags to us and didn't do anything for us. They said it was canceled due to weather issues (although the email said something else). They didn't provide any voucher for a taxi or hotel. My flight got postponed for 24 hours.	0
Calgary to El Salvador via Mexico City. Aeromexico in Calgary, never checked that my passport had 5 months and 28 days to expire, in Mexico City they did not allow me to take the next flight to El Salvador. I have to stay in Mexico City and after 3 days, spending more than US$1,000 the Canadian embassy issued a temporary passport. At this point my nightmare continued, they lost one of my 4 bags that l checked in Calgary. After one month dealing with this company, they only paid me back $1,100 Canadian dollars and my claim was for $4,000 US.	0
London to Cork. The flight service is reasonable for the money, they charge for everything, bags ,meals and all seats with charges depends on the class. But the booking through the airline website is a disaster, I booked my flight online where for 1st time after completing the booking process including the payment the the window took long time look like loading or processing and surprisingly the window back to where all the flight details again and I have to start all over again. I waited 10-15 mins when I did not receive any confirmation email as well as I have created account where it did not show any booked trip, so I went back and booked my flight which is urgent and I needed to confirm the booking for my company. When I received the bank statement I found out they charge me twice where there is only receipt of one flight and one person. Calling the customer service did not help as nothing in their system Proof this duplicate payment so I have to fill the online form for refund where the only proof is the bank statement that is made me look like i took advantage of the company money and the investigation in the airline in the email said they may take up 60 days! What kind of poor service is this	0
Knock to Gatwick. I am just onboard my very late return to London. I dread the flights as it does not leave on time. This is a budget airline charging a premium. This set of flights cost over £400. Ryanair cost half but for me fly into the wrong airport. I was kind of hoping the cost would mean quality but no. Far from it.	0
Dublin to Orlando. Everything was fine with the flight except the lady in front of my husband decided to put her seat back and refused to move it, even when he was served his snack. Staff would not help. Did not ask her to sit upright until the very last minute before we landed, even though everyone else had been asked to do this half an hour before in preparation for landing. You get what you pay for and next time we will pay for Virgin. It is worth it!	0
Beijing to San Francisco. Worst customer service ever. We were told that there were business class seats available for upgrade purchase but they kept on telling us that we had to wait for people to come to our gate. When someone finally came to the gate. She was very unpleasant and didn’t even acknowledge us and just gave us this dirty look as if we were bothering her. Never again will we fly with this airline again. Everyone does not know how to help people that do not speak their language and they have a whole lot of attitudes. They shouldn’t work in a customer service based job if they don’t know how to deal with customers. If I was able to rate it a 0 out of 10 I would have	0
Manchester to Toronto via Moncton. Terrible experience from start to finish. Budget airline now nothing like the airline we travelled with years ago so dont be fooled into thinking it is an upgrade airline, I would compare it to as poor Ryanair. 3 out of 4 flights were delayed, no meals given, no apologies, no compensation whatsoever. Baggage did not arrive on our onward flight. What more can I say only I will never fly with Air Canada rouge again. They offered us discounted flights for this year, but who would want to go through that experience again, we are pensioners for goodness sake.	0
Toronto to Miami. You pay with points or cash for business class but it’s no better than economy on most other airlines. Air Canada should be ashamed. Unless I cannot use another airline I’ll avoid Rouge, even if I have to pay more. No room in overhead bins. Can barely fit anything under seat either!	0
Horrible customer service who was not empathetic with my flight being cancelled and Air Canada not being able to accommodate me on a different direct flight that day. Did absolutely nothing to make up for the schedule change. Horrible. Will never fly with Air Canada again.	0
Worst flight experience. Travelled with two small children and two car seats. When flight was booked it stated one carryon and one personal item per passenger. We took 2 carry on bags and strapped the car seats to each for more convenient transport since we had two small children in tow. When we went to get boarding passes, they told us we had to check our carryons. I told them it was our mode of transport for the car seats and they said it was policy on small full flights that all carryons be checked unless flying business class. I said can we just check at the gate if there is truly no space. Again told no. I said it would have been nice to have been told this information sooner than the day of the flight o we could have arranged for a different mode of transport for the car seats or packages them properly to check them. The first gate wasn’t too far but to get to the connecting flight it was far. We had to carry these bulky awkward car seats with no good surfaces to hold the entire trip. When we boarded the first flight and the flight attendants were closing the overhead storage compartments, they closed several empty compartments, yet we had to check our bags. Upon arrival to our destination we found that they had now lost our carry on luggage that they forced us to check in the first place. Reported that it was not there and they told us it was in our layover city and they would get it in next possible flight and deliver that evening or next day. Second day of no luggage and we are going to have to buy more diapers and toothbrushes and hairbrush and at least a change of clothes for our children. They cannot even tell us where the luggage is when we call. They are marked and scanned throughout the process so how is that not registering in the system when they enter in the id number for the tagged bags. This is not the first time we have lost luggage on a flight, but it is the first time we have not been able to get information regarding the process of retrieval. There is no good contact number to just call and file a complaint. It was an email process. This airline is in no way accommodating to family travel aside from somewhat early boarding. They give conflicting information when you do talk to a company representative, and offer no real answer as to how they are working to resolve your issue. They offer zero compensation for the major inconvenience.	0
I have had a very bad experience with Air Canada. I was flying round trip from London to Toronto late last year and they completely destroyed my luggage. After a rude encounter with the Air Canada lady at Toronto airport I had to go through months of unanswered emails and calls to try and sort out the situation. Eventually they agreed to refund me for my damaged baggage 3 months later. However, they would only send me a compensation in a Canadian bank account, which of course I don't have as I am a tourist. I explained this over multiple emails and calls, but nothing happened. I was told repeatedly to just be patient and they would contact me when they could find the time! That never happened. The voucher for the compensation expired and they never answered my demands for an alternative payment type. It has now been over 6 months and I have lost all faith. I believe they never intended to compensate me or indeed any other foreigner. I am convinced that if I was a Canadian they would have compensated me ages ago.	0
Seattle to Medellin via LAX / Mexico City. Aeromexico made major changes to my itinerary, instead of waiting 2 hours in each airport (how I booked the flight) I would have to wait 16 hours on my first flight and 11 hours on the second one. For this reason I could not take this flight. The airline offered me a refund of 100% of the cost of my ticket. Now that the flight was cancelled they are putting all the responsibility to the agency that I booked with saying that I have to talk with the agency. While the agency tells me that they have accepted giving me a refund but they need the refund from the airline. The agency is still waiting for the money back to give me my refund. And at the same time Aeromexico throws the ball to the agency. I have been on this issue for more than two weeks. Every time I call the answers I get are very blurry and they don't give me a straight forward answer. I have requested to talk with supervisors but they say that the supervisors are not there. Or simply they leave me waiting for one hour of waiting on the phone and finally they hang up (this has happened several times).	0
Quito to Mexico City. In Quito, I locked my suitcase with a TSA-approved lock. When I claimed it in Mexico City, the two metal fasteners to which the lock had been attached had both been cut and the lock was gone. Apparently the perpetrators were not interested in what was inside (mostly dirty laundry!), but the suitcase was permanently damaged and can no longer be locked. I complained to AeroMexico online, which promised a prompt response. 5 weeks later, I got an e-mail from them giving me a case number and asking for photos of the suitcase, my boarding pass, the luggage receipt, and my passport. I furnished those. They then replied that the damage was considered "minor" and not eligible for compensation "under our internal policies." So, tough luck, customer. Buyer, beware. I will not fly Aeromexico again.	0
Cancun to Mexico City. I am a frequent flyer and I have never experienced anything worse from any airline. 5 hour delay for a 25 minute flight and then refusing to let a family with a baby to board the plane because their attitude was bad. They are rude and disrespectful to customers. We had  paid for an upgrade and it was removed at the airport. We were told to speak to the customer service hotline to try get a refund for the upgrade. Good luck with that!	0
Terrible customer service.  I needed to make some last minute changes to my itinerary. I was given a quotation for the changes which Aer Lingus later advised was given in error but they refused to honour. I had to pay nearly 3 times the original quotation. They also made errors on the amount they charged my credit in Euros and have so far refused to resolve the issue. The flights themselves were uneventful but disappointing. The planes were old but had maybe been refitted with new seats in recent years. The inflight entertainment is basic and I found it hardly worth watching. My USB charger point did not work and only one earphone worked. I ordered 2 kids meals and 2 gluten free meals 48 hrs in advance and did not receive any of them. The final insult was having to pay for alcoholic beverages on the flights.	0
Hartford to Dublin, I booked this August 2018 flight for my honeymoon back in December. When I went to go through my itinerary for my entire trip one last time my flight was cancelled! I received no notice of this I had already been charged and my fiancé and I spent over 10  hours on hold starting Friday afternoon and did not get in touch with someone until Sunday morning who said no one could help us over the phone it had to be done through email! At this point we were in a straight panic and had to rebook so now we have paid twice for our honeymoon and frankly are too frustrated to even be excited about it. Still have not received any response from numerous emails sent and numerous claims submitted through their website. Not to mention I booked directly with Aer Lingus thinking that would put in the most secure position for my honeymoon travel plans!!!	0
Booked 12 tickets for my family to go to my daughter's wedding. After a flight cancellation on the last 10 travelers and later flight delay on United, our Aer Lingus flight was missed. (Aer Lingus booked the first 7 tickets but said they were out of seats on the United flight, so they had me book the last 5 directly.) 4 Tickets were rebooked on United but since Aer Lingus refused to release the tickets for the last 5 travelers, they were left in Newark. Had to purchase new tickets on Norwegian the next day. Aer Lingus left a family with a special needs child at the airport and refused to help. Customer service was non existent, wouldn't provide a person to talk to and said the only recourse was to file a complaint on line. The answer to the complaint was United Airlines ruined the plans, but Aer Lingus is not responsible.	0
I have flown with Air China for the third time and this will be my last. Service is terrible. Flight attendants were rude at times. Food is also terrible. Since it's first come first served, there is no guarantee you can choose what meat you prefer since it will run out. The rice is always bad, so sticky and the noodles are not better. People (and flight attendants) will speak Chinese to you if you are Asian and mostly will continue to do so even when you tell them you are not Chinese. Transiting in Beijing is also a terrible experience. If you don't know where to go, even if you ask they are not very happy and look very annoyed that you asked. Or worse, just shouted at you in Chinese and pointed to somewhere. The time of transit is very short, which you will easily miss your next flight (more troubles). The last thing I am most frustrated about is, at the end of the flight, you will likely lose your luggages. Happened a few times already. And when it does, you have to wait at least 3 days for it to delivered (very late at night). So, never again.	0
Vancouver to Hong Kong via Beijing. I have never been compelled to write a review for anything. Ever. That was until I experienced the absolute most horrendous customer service from Air China.  I was travelling with a group of 7. I had booked a round trip from Edmonton to Hong Kong. This booking was done via Flight Hub which would include an Air Canada flight from Edmonton to Vancouver and an Air China flight to HK. Upon arrival at the airport in Edmonton Air Canada alerted me that my middle name was missing from the flight info and were happy to add it. Air Canada updated both my boarding passes. When I got to Vancouver I went to the Air China check in counter to receive my boarding pass and I waited 2 hours until they told me I wouldn't be allowed on the flight because of my missing middle name. This information came was communicated to me 10 minutes before gate closing. This gave me absolutely no time to contact Air Canada or Flight Hub for help. Air China were unwilling to add my middle name despite showing my passport and other government issued IDs. I had to cancel and rebook my entire round trip because they wouldn't add my middle name on the return flight either. One of my friends stayed behind and took the flight with me. On the return flight my friend was rejected from the flight for "breaking the sequence". Upon enquiry Air China confirmed that his seat was still reserved for him but he would have to pay an $1200 USD to get it back. Air China was incredibly unhelpful and threatened to call security when was asked why he was rejected from the flight even though they themselves confirmed the seat was reserved for him.	0
Seoul Gimpo to Beijing. I have to admit that this is the first time that i have been driven to write a review of an airline. I have elite status on Star Alliance and One World. In all my travels i have never come across a worse airline than Air China. I am writing today warn off my fellow travelers from this airline which probably should be de-certified in a number of territories. I recently booked a ticket from Seoul to Beijing on the US website. Unfortunately there is a glitch in a the system and my name repeated itself (for example it appears as John John Smith Smith). I also can confirm this was not me accidentally entering my name twice because - before noticing the error - I booked a second itinerary and the same thing happened. And now for the incredible waste of time. The US 800 number basically does not answer. When calling the 24 hour number in China given their poor English they seemed convinced that I was somehow trying to do a name change. The UK number answers on a loop - throughout the UK work day - that the call center opens at 9am. Then disconnects. The French number on the Air China website is not valid. The loss of time in the last 48 hours has been absolutely breathtaking and I would have paid the double with another airline had I known. Resolution? 40 minutes to get a US rep who asked that I send my passport in despite confirming that there is a glitch in their booking system which allows for passenger names to be repeated. Still waiting for confirmation that the issue is resolved. Avoid Air China. Buyer Beware.	0
I flew from Montreal to Phoenix via Toronto. Toronto to Phoenix there was no room for cabin luggage that were sent to luggage bay. And my checked luggage did not make it to Phoenix. The Air Canada employees in Phoenix were very reassuring. It was Monday 11:30pm and they told me that the luggage was still in Toronto and will be delivered at home tomorrow morning. On Tuesday morning, no bag was delivered and I phone to customer service : they told me the luggage was not located. On Wednesday, 48h after the lost of my luggage, I phone back to customer service and the status of luggage was still "lost". I took the name and number of the employee and asked to speak to his supervisor. The supervisor called me back 5 minutes later to tell me that the baggage was found in the meantime.  I spent 500USD that day to replace some sporting goods in the luggage, but the supervisor gave me only 200USD of compensation given that the bag will be delivered on flight AC1837 the next day. The delivery at home could take 24h, so I said I will come to the airport. At 12pm, the status of my luggage on "world tracker" website was still indicating that the bag was on flight 1837 that left Toronto at 8am. I came to the airport and surprisingly the bag was not there. An employee  told me that the status of the bag changed 15 minutes after landing of flight 1837 : the status is now that the bag will arrive at midnight, via flight 1835. Never trust world tracker website : even if the bag is not on the plane, the status indicates the opposite even after landing of the plane 4 hours late ! The incompetence of the employees makes this website useless. I asked explanation to the employee and he showed me on his computer that my bag was a rush bag. Why Air Canada did not tag my delayed bag as urgent (72h delay at this time) as they are supposed to do with delayed bag? I finally got my luggage on Friday at 1am after coming 12h later at the airport. On the way back there was no room for my cabin luggage, and it was sent to luggage bay. But they put the wrong name on the luggage tag and I had to quickly ask to put the right tag on my luggage unless it would be lost somewhere.	0
Toronto to Porto with Air Canada rouge. Older plane, delayed by 2 hours due to technical problem. Not much leg space, even for those seats for extra $100. For in-flight entertainment you need to download an app prior to boarding, it didn’t work for us. One AC outlet for 2 seats. I found flight attendants rude, no tea/coffee. One piece of luggage delayed for 24 hours.	0
Flew Punta Cana to Toronto. Complete trash airline. Mechanical delays are frequent and they do nothing to compensate except give a useless discount on your next flight which none of us will ever use because we will never book with Air Canada rouge again. Flight to vacation delayed 6 hours flight coming home delayed 6 hours now stuck at the resort with no room or accommodations and they do nothing.	0
The worst airline on the planet. They will cancel your flights, make you sleep in the airport and not refund your money after you find a competent airline to get you home. I made it home with the other airline before the Air Canada flight ever left. They will make you wait in very long line ups and then spend hours on the phone to get zero results.

Horrible Customer service. Our first flight was delayed 6-7 hours due to “technical issues” which was going to make us miss our connecting flight, and the only other flight they could get us on was 7 hours after we land in our connecting city,  a total of 13 hours in delays and the only compensation they gave us was one, $300 MXN or ($20 CAD) voucher for food at only one restaurant for the 13 hour delay. It was almost insulting to receive that voucher. I am disgusted in the customer service and policies they claim the must  follow.	0
Washington to Mexico City was uneventful other than the fact that the plane was incredibly old, reeked of fuel, and there was zero padding left on any of the seats. MEX back IAD and beyond was where AeroMexico showed its true colors. While attempting to board the plane we were informed that there was customs form that was mandatory to board. Absolutely our fault for not having these (we arrived 10 days prior and had discarded these not knowing how important they were). We were told that we needed to go back to the immigration office and get new ones and that it would take 5 minutes and they would wait. So we ran and while sprinting back up to the gate they looked up saw us approaching and proceeded finish closing the boarding door. We begged, pleaded, etc obviously to no avail. After that we were basically treated like dog sh*t to be scraped off a shoe and be rid of as quickly as possible. We were told by the gate agents (just rude angry people) ticketing agents (dead-eyed and uncaring) and supervisor (slightly more sympathetic but also completely unwilling to actually do anything for us) that immigration documentation is our responsibility, and as such we would need to pay $250USD per plus about $400 in fare difference (that's $650 each or $1,300 in total y'all) to simply get rebooked on the same flight the next day (it had seats available). Trying to get us on another earlier flight with a partner airline was completely out of the question. Uninterested in this extortion we ended up paying for a hotel for the night and used points to book a return flight on a real airline. But hold on folks it gets better! Our bags! They were checked on the original flight. Upon returning to the US I called their 800 number and got someone who told me that I needed to call the lost and found line (a Mexican number). This not sounding quite right to me (I had the bag tags and wanted them to just do a search and locate them) I asked if there was a supervisor I could speak to. I was put on hold and after waiting for over an hour, ultimately hung up. The number he gave me to call is unsurprisingly not in service. At as loss for what to do I drove to the airport and went to the ticket counter (they fly one flight a day out IAD and don't have a baggage office). Here I found some nice people that actually tried to help. They did a search and told me the bags were still in Mexico City. "Oh Wait, they didn't tell you?" she says. When you don't board a flight that you checked bags on they're required to remove your bags from the flight before they depart! You should have been told to pick them up in Mexico City and recheck them on your next flight! They filed a request to have the bags brought up on the next flight and promised to call with an update on when that would be the next day. That was two days ago. They gave me a number to call and check on the bags. It goes directly to a VM box. I left a message. Not confident I'll get a response. There are thousands of dollars worth of climbing gear and technical clothing in those bags. I guess it's possible that I will see this all again but I'm losing hope. For anyone who might have had baggage issues with this airline here's the baggage number: 571-502-8784. Bottom Line, stay away. It's not worth the $100 you might save to fly on this airline. Incompetence and a customer service apparatus that is very clearly designed to keep you at arms length and make it impossible get help.	0
Birmingham to Athens return. Main reason I used Aegean on this route is the direct flight during Summer time as Aegean doesn't fly the route during Winter and I usually fly Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian or Turkish Airlines throughout the year. Really disappointed to realise that the airline I was once proud of has fallen behind the competition. The aircraft was late on departure both ways of my trip. The seats are too close to each other and too narrow (30 ins pitch as LH). The food was unacceptable for a Greek airline that represents the country with the best cuisine in the world, both ways of my journey exactly the same food and each time worse that the previous one.  Cabin crew professional but with attitude and poor training, Night flight and they left the lights on throughout the whole flight without dimming them, announcements were too loud and hasty (especially in English), asked for water twice and they forgot it both times. The  magazine torn from previous use. Lufthansa uses small plastic holders where they offer the magazine so it doesn't get spoiled by use. Finally inflight entertainment is absent.	0
Los Angeles to Dublin. Made a reservation and bought an exit row seat for $70. A few days before my outbound flight I checked my flight details and found that they had changed my seat to a regular seat. I called and got it changed back. On the day I left they changed it to a regular seat again and I had to fight to get my exit row $70 seat back. Crooked behavior! Then at check in they refused to check my back through from Dublin to Leeds on an Aer Lingus flight because, I bought the ticket from Expedia? They told me if I wanted the convenience of checking bags through I had to buy the ticket directly from them. They do not participate in the TSA or Global Entry programs so I waited 1 hour 23 minutes in security at LAX which is always absolute chaos in terminal 2. In flight crew were at best indifferent and mostly just rude. One very small meal two hours after takeoff then not even a snack for 10 hours. Wine outrageously expensive and water was not offered once for 10 hours. When I went back to the galley to ask for water the curtain was drawn so no passengers welcome! Arrival was chaotic (jetway was wrongly placed). I would never fly this airline again. They said that the $70 seat got me priority boarding and at the gate they told me, no you wait till your row is called! Today I was supposed to fly from Leeds to Dublin and then from Dublin back to LA the Dublin flight so far is delayed over 5 hours. I have been waiting 2 hours to even talk to someone about getting rebooked but no one available and again, they refused to check my bag through to LA because I booked the Leeds to Dublin flight through Expedia even though both my flights are on Aer Lingus. Absolute chaos with delay, no one has a clue what to do. Avoid this mickey mouse airline at all costs. Not only are they horribly inefficient but their personnel are either very rude or worse, indifferent.	0
This was the worst trip ever. The crew on the ground doesn’t have a clue of what they’re doing. It took them 3 hrs before they announced that our flight was cancelled due to mechanical issues. Then there was a staff who informed us that we will be refunded the amount of our new flight if we rebook the flight ourselves as their person are taking a long time doing the rebooking. After we rebook a flight with another airline, we were then informed that a full refund is not a guaranteed and was given a Delayed Flight Form that we are to give to their Air China colleagues when we arrive in Vancouver. I was already mad as we had to take care of everything ourselves and have been misinformed. This misinformation costs me $925 CAD. A very expensive misinformation. When I got to Vancouver, the 2 employees on their Air China booth said they can’t assist me with my issues and to call or email Air China! So I called. I called more than 10 times now and the call keeps getting cut off. I also sent an email and there was no help there either. Thanks was told to cancel the booking and request a refund (no detailed information given) But it won’t be the $925 I paid to get to Vancouver. I was also told to call the Philippine office. When I asked if they’re going to cover my overseas call charges, I never heard anything back. I will never recommend them to anyone. Worst customer service! If there’s a zero rating here, that’s what I’ll score them.	0
Los Angeles to Osaka via Beijing. The seats are narrow and a packed Air China plane is not comfortable, especially for a long haul. I had to transfer in Beijing. For some reason I've not been able to figure out, the itinerary I'd been sold didn't leave enough time to get from the arrival gate to the departure gate of the connecting flight. I don't know if that was Air China's fault or the agent (Flighthub)'s fault. The Air China personnel at the airport strenuously maintained that it wasn't their fault. They claimed their only responsibility was to take off on time, and if I missed the connecting flight, that was my fault. Out of the goodness of their hearts, they said, they would allow me to board another flight the next morning. So I had to wait around in Beijing airport for a flight the next morning. As a result, I incurred some expense from missed connections and reservations in Japan. Although I've not been able to find out to this day whose fault it was that I missed my connection, Air China's unsympathetic attitude towards stranded travelers struck me unfavorably, and I'll probably try to avoid doing business with them again.	0
Toronto to Mexico City. I paid for extra leg room as I am tall (6'5") and on the return trip from Mexico the trip was abominable. I had to either spread my legs out, or cross them in forming an X. In addition, because the airline charges for checked baggage, there was no room for my backpack except under my seat, which limited the available leg room even more. Three days after the experience, I still have back pain and leg cramps. In addition, the app for inflight service demanded to be updated, and the wifi provided by the place did not allow for the update except by paying wifi fees. I will never fly with Air Canada Rouge again.	0
I travelled round trip from Seattle to Punta Cana via Toronto. On the way there, there were several issues. First off, seats were highly uncomfortable. Furthermore, the cushions were poorly secured, and slid around underneath you. The leg room was nonexistent. I literally could not fit my knees in front of me on the plane.  There were no power outlets or Wi-Fi on the plane. The return flight was what really set this experience apart though. Terrible seats, no leg room, no amenities. However, the airline made a mistake scheduling the flight, causing it to be 3 hours delayed. Our layover was 3 hours and 40 minutes, which meant that we would have 20 minutes to get to our gate. We contacted the airline about this, and they assured us that we would easily be able to make our connection (quote “that is plenty of time to get there”), and that they would hold the plane back a few minutes to wait for us if necessary. Upon arriving after an uncomfortable and long flight, we could not make it to the other gate in time, and they refused to hold it back for us. The airline scheduled us flights to Seattle the next day, with a layover. We were supposed to get to Seattle Sunday afternoon, but our new flight plan had us arriving late Monday evening. We then waited over 2 hours in line at a very busy and crowded Air Canada service desk. the service was incredibly slow, but eventually they told us that there were much better flights we could have got that would have gotten us home much earlier, but they sold out in the time we stood in the line. I am writing this review from the run down hotel they offered us, after having a meager dinner with the insufficient food vouchers they gave us. I fly a lot, but my entire experience with Air Canada was consistently and extremely awful.	0
Fort Lauderdale to Montreal on Air Canada. Check in was smooth and handled by a friendly and courteous agent at the Priority counter. Unfortunately things went downhill from there on. Boarding was absolute mayhem with gate agents giving conflicting instructions. To make matters worse, instead of using the zone-based queues at the designated gate, they decided to use the lanes of the neighbouring gate causing a mass migration, not to mention confusion, for some 200 passengers. The gate agents were not only unorganized they were actually surly with the passengers. In the end it became a free-for-all boarding experience. When I got on board, I mentioned the chaos at the gate to one of the agents who was not even remotely interested in hearing about it and pretty much brushed it off. We were almost 40 minutes late leaving FLL which stretched the flight duration from 3 hours to 4 gate to gate. During this time the FA’s came around with water and beverage service only once and acted as if they were doing the passengers a favour. In all my travels around the globe I have never encountered a flight crew so aloof and uninterested in doing their jobs. The hard product was decent and the IFE had a good selection of movies, music and games. The washrooms looked like they had not been tended to in weeks and they surely were not going to receive any attention from the crew operating the flight. After landing, it took almost 40 minutes for the bags to be delivered. I have travelled over 1.3 million miles with Air Canada and this one has to be the poorest experience I have had.	0
The seats that are comically narrow for an average-sized person. I made the mistake of purchasing two round-trip tickets from Orlando to Montréal, hoping for a comfortable flight next to my wife in a two-seat row. Unfortunately, the seats proved to be too small by 2 to 4 inches for most people, and for me, almost six inches. While I am 6 feet 2 inches tall and weigh 280 lbs, I am not excessively large. As soon as the seatbelt sign was turned off, I had to stand for the entire flight until it was back on, as there was no comfort in those seats for either me or my wife. The flight attendants were indifferent to our plight. In particular, one of them kept knocking into my wife whenever she passed by. Although it was probably not intentional, my wife eventually had to change seats to avoid her. Moreover, the crew at the Orlando airport was making overlapping announcements, making it impossible to comprehend their boarding process and group numbers.	0
Terrible airline! My direct flight was cancelled due to bad weather. Air Canada rescheduled my flight for the next day with a layover without checking if that works for me. My and my husband tried to contact Air Canada to cancel rescheduled flights but no one was answering the phone. It was not possible to get hold of anyone. I tried to dispute $427 transaction without success. Don’t use this airline!	0
11th April SU0260 Moscow-Tokyo. 21st April SU261 Tokyo-Moscow. Flew on a Airbus A330 from Tokyo to Amsterdam through Moscow. First time Aeroflot but never again. A list of disappointments: All announcements were in 3 languages: Russian English and Japanese even the sales and priority rewards announcements. During the 9 hour flight we only got a cold drink once(!) even during dinner we didn't get anything to drink other than coffee or tea afterwards. This was a day flight and I didn't sleep so I didn't miss anything I'm sure. 1.5 hour delay which is perfectly acceptable for me but don't let us board and tell us every 5 minutes that the delay will be an extra 5 minutes (and in 3 languages again). The sign "fasten seatbelts" was lit for 3/4 of the flight but I didn't feel any turbulence at all seemed like the stewards didn't want people to stretch their legs. Very outdated multimedia system no subtitles available. Stewards refuse to speak English and explains everything in Russian constantly.	0
San Francisco to Guadalajara. This company has the worst customer service. There are many things that they did wrong. First, our flight got delayed because of the bad weather but we managed to get to the airport for our connecting flight 1 hour prior to departure. However, there was no staff from Aeromexico at the counter so we couldn't get our boarding pasess. No self-check in option either. Called customer service and their solution was to book another flight because they couldn't do anything. What an awful, stressful and enraging experience. Never booking with them again.	0
Flew Rhodes to Athens with Aegean. Cabin crew were rude and unfriendly as I don't speak Greek. Seat was dirty from the previous person on the previous flight. They didn't care, they just wanted to get everyone on board. No apologies. Used to love travelling with Aegean but their service has really gone downhill these last few months.	0
Hong Kong to Vienna via Beijing.. Horrible experience with Air China. Flight was late due to bad weather. Sitting on a plane. Out of nowhere went up. Circling above Hong Kong then trying to avoid the thunder storm we did not know was being ahead. Terrifying turbulence. Then 1,5 hour with total helplessness what was going on. Flight attendants did not know either. Captain speaking: "Need to land in Wuhan due to bad weather" - flight cancelled. Stuck at immigration desk (literally). Officers could not let us thru as we did not have Chinese visa - did not need any when you traveled to Hong Kong. Cannot go thru unless there is a new itinerary booked for us. It was 2am entire airport closed till 6am. No english speaking people in Wuhan Airport. Booking system opened at 6:30am. Took ages to get a new itinerary. Surprisingly the new flight times were not able to fit each other. Long story short - after 20hrs spending in China we finally flew away home. Never ever fly with Air China.	0
Nice to Montreal. We had an overseas flight which was over 8 hours. First, the seats are narrow and short with very little leg room. There was no entertainment system at all. We were only served a hot beverage once the whole flight. We had a little turbulence, but the flight was over 8 hours! I would not book with this airline again.	0
The worst airline to travel with. I have had baggage issues twice with this airline. The last one was in Oct. 2022 and they still haven’t refunded me for my broken bag which was due to their negligence. They don’t even give a single cup of coffee free in their flight. When it comes to refunding, they just take you round and round and they say oh the case is being escalated. For $250 USD I have been waiting for 6 months now. Unacceptable customer service at every level..	0
Flew from DUS-SVO-BKK. I am at a loss of words for the unfriendly staff. We had the feeling that they were annoyed about our presence in the plane. I have never experienced such unfriendly staff in my life. In addition 4 hours late without even explaining the delay. The Inflight-entertainment system itself was not bad. I would say slightly below average but still okay. The problem were the headphones. The headphones were so bad that you could not understand a word. So we could not watch a single movie during our 10 hour flight. At least no movie with sound. Food was standard. Neither good nor bad. I would not complain if the price would have been low. But it was pretty much the same as other airlines like Emirates or Etihad. 1/10 will never fly with Aeroflot again.	0
Washington DC to Mexico City. Horrible customer service - I will never fly with Aeromexico again. 3 hour flight delay from Dulles to Mexico City caused me to miss my connection. Customer service barely understood English and showed little concern. I found them rude and unhelpful. I ask my wife (who is Mexican and speaks fluent Spanish and English) to assist me in changing my return flight which was also on Aeromexico. The customer service person was not only rude to her as well but they provided inaccurate information regarding their own flight routes and hung up instead of trying to understand the request of their customer. Never again. I gave them one star because they are the only flight from Washington D.C. to Mexico City overnight direct.	0
Mexico City to Huatulco. I have nothing against the flight attendants but our experience with the Aeromexico airport crew and phone customer service reps last June have been nothing but horrendous. We had a connecting flight in Mexico City that was canceled because of a storm and I understand that it is out of your control. But what happened after that was the problem. We were by the gate when they canceled the flight, no one would help us rebook nor recover our checked luggages. All they had given us was a local number to call for instructions. Good thing I had friends who were able to speak Spanish and had phones with them but even with that we couldn't get help. The number they gave us was useless and we couldn't go in the carousel area since they would not let us in to just get our bags. After a couple of hours of running around the place and pleading with security so they can let us in to get our unsecured luggages in the middle of the arrival area, we were able to rebook a flight. Then they canceled that flight too and so we had to do everything all over again. It was a nightmare. On our way back, we were downgraded from business class to coach. So they apologized and compensated us with a voucher with an instruction that I can use it to upgrade any future round trip Aeromexico tickets. But the catch is that I should use the voucher within a year. Now, I called customer service and they are not helping me in any way. I have booked my flights and wanted to use the voucher but they are asking me to do a lot of things before I can use the voucher. This is just unacceptable. This second experience isn't helping my frustration with the first experience. I feel like I'm in Mexico City airport again trying to figure out what to do without anyone trying to help. It is just too much work for me to be able to use the voucher as what I have been told. To have an upgrade for any roundtrip tickets of aeromexico. I mean, I am not even asking for free flights. I am only asking to use the voucher that I have been given. I have not heard back from anyone.	0
Tuxtla Gutierrez to SFO via Mexico City. I few with Aeromexico in August in three segments from Tuxtla Gutierrez to SFO, and I wanted to get miles credit for these three flights. But the SkyTeam website and their customer service seemed incompetent to me and I am giving up trying to get the credit for these flights. I sent them a message by website too, but no response. On the other hand, I contacted United MileagePlus for Avianca flight (on the flight there), and I got the credit soon.	0
Athens to Brussels. The quality of the service is getting worse. I regularly pick this operator for my flights from Brussels to Athens and back. During my last trip not only we faced delay, but also the information provided was not accurate. They did not clearly communicate the reason of the delay and kept on stating that the flight will leave at 18.00 although it was 5 minutes later.	0
Seattle to Birmingham via Dublin. This was my first time flying through this airline. The transatlantic flight from Seattle to Dublin was delayed, awfully dirty and the seats wouldn't recline. The staff was impolite. The domestic flight from Dublin to Birmingham was worse it was delayed and the management was a mess. As I was getting through security, the airline updated the monitors that the flight had left, whereas they hadn't even started boarding. The also lost and damaged my luggage and were always unaccessible whenever I reached out. This flight was cheap and the food (on the transatlantic carrier only) was good but the pros are not worth the hassle.  Their organization is a mess and they are unreliable. If you do decide to fly through them, get travel insurance and cover your bases.	0
Philadelphia to Manchester via Dublin. This was one of the worst flights I have flown. We were unable to check-in online the night before and without i=forming us, we were given seats that didn't recline, for the 8 hr trip. The food was appalling. The return flight wasn't much better. After having the same issue with checking in, I called the airline to try and check in the day before so we wouldn't get stuck with bad seats again, and they informed us that even though we had an Aer Lingus Reference Number they couldn't help us because it was booking through Expedia. After getting to the airport and waiting at the gate, boarding time comes and an announcement is made that the flight is delayed because a crew member hadn't showed up yet. No updates were given, and a supervisor was loud with some of the passengers that were just looking for an update. You would think that Aer Lingus would have back up crew members. Unable to even board the plane, a full flight was waiting on the punctuality of a single crew member. After an hour of waiting the single missing cabin crew member shows up and we can finally board. The plane was freezing cold, I asked for a blanket two times from the flight attendant and never received one. Customer service is appalling, seats uncomfortable, plane was outdated and food disgusting.	0
We flew from Philadelphia to Dublin and on to Heathrow, return. The planes that carried us across the Atlantic (ASL Airlines) were vintage 1970s. My seat arm rest fell off. On the return flight, the seat backs were not attached to the metal frames and the seat cushion had not 'cushion' or springs or whatever makes them comfortable for 7 hours. The toilets smelled like urinals in some very dank Dublin pub - disgusting! The food was not edible. This was the worst airline experience we ever had - and that includes flying in countries that are not considered "first world." In addition, it is impossible to talk with someone at Are Lingus-1 hour and 45 minutes on hold with Irish music was enough to count as torture. Never actually talked to anyone. I even called the Dublin telephone number and got the same hold and music.  And they charged for water on the flight from Dublin to Heathrow - Really?	0
For an almost 2 hours flight to Bucharest from Berlin TXL we we're served a 20g pack of potato chips which was described as snack. Every airBerlin flight the "snacks" become smaller and smaller but this is too much. That bag of potato chips will cost anywhere less than 1 Euro and I think this becomes towards a customer humiliating. There are always the same unhappy stewardess-faces always looking like they can't wait to finish their shift and go home. Not to mention that at the airport we were sent in an improved Terminal with only two flights very crowded and absolutely no duty free facilities. I am fed up with this airline and I have given up my topbonus card after one year of bad experiences with them. I hope I will never have to travel again with them. The only plus I can give the flight was in time.	0
Barcelona to Montreal. Worst international flying experience! Seats are old and uncomfortable and jammed very close together. No TV screens or entertainment at all for an 9 hour flight. I later heard they had iPads for rent to watch a movie but we were not informed by the staff. We were unfortunate to get seats in the very last row facing the toilets which added an insult to an injury. Strong smell of urine through the flight, non-reclinable seat back, last in line to be served for anything. By our row no choice of food was left and what was offered contained nothing but load of cheap carbs - potato salad, pasta with nothing in it and bread so hard it felt like days old. The flight we booked was supposed to be with different airline but they flipped the airline on us for unknown reason. Feel cheated and very disappointed. The only good thing to say is about ground service. With extremely tight connection interval our bags made it to the second leg of the flight.	0
Toronto to Berlin. This was the worst overseas flight of my life. Horribly dated and uncomfortable seats, very poor beverage and food service, terrible seat positioning (right next to the back toilet, really?!) and overall a horrible decision.  Air Canada Rouge has been my worst experience so far, and I would not suggest it to anyone.	0
Toronto to Ft Lauderdale. Air Canada used to be great, with delightful service, great in-flight entertainment, legroom, and comfortable seats. When they realized that they have the monopoly and can charge whatever they want, they took the oldest planes from the main fleet, got rid of their IFEs, cut down on crew members, packed more seats onto the plane, and charged the same price as they used to with Air Canada rouge. They can't lose customers because a lot of people have no where else to go! I checked in early for my flight, on the app, but I received row 32, the last row on the plane. IFE weren't supposed to be an issue for me because they replaced it with mobile entertainment. Air Canada gave me an alert saying the service is unavailable on my fully capable product, running the correct version of iOS and the app. Ok, we don't have IFE, let's buy wifi. Right? Nope. 8.95 CAD/hour. I'm very disappointed with the services provided on Air Canada rouge.	0
Terrible customer service, change our flight schedule from early morning to midnight. Instead of finding an option I was asked if I just want a refund. Disregard whether customers has plan on the day of arrival, or has booked a hotel or rent a vehicle, Air Canada can just change the schedule without letting you know	0
So so bad! My flight in to NYC - even though I have confirmed my ticket months ahead of time. I ended up having a standby ticket? On my way back I've had to check my carry on and wait for it at the carousel. Staff were rude! Now I hate that airline and will avoid flying with them ever again.	0
Do not use this company. I just purchased two tickets for my wife and 7 year old daughter, and I paid extra money for seats that can seat right next to each other. But when she checked in and board airplane, the seats are not the same we're supposed to have. They had to sit separately. So I called Customer service and they said they don't care, there is nothing they can do. They did not say sorry and couldn't refund the money that I paid extra.	0
New York JFK to Buenos Aires via Mexico. This was by far the worst experience that I have. The customer service was the worst. I have no idea where they recruit their staff but they are very disrespectful. I checked my bag and I passed the weight limit by half pound. Well she said that I have to pay extra, but i have a carry on bag and i said i will put that half pound in my carry on. Then she said that she has to weight my carry on. At this point I was annoyed, not only because of the situation but they way she was telling me. Long story short I had to paid $260 dollar more to check in my carry on. The worst part is that she was chit chatting with her co-worker and laughing while charging my credit card. After all the procedure she get back to me with that poker face and said "by the way the flight is delay". I really doubt that the airline provided any customer service training to this people but I guess we have to start with an apology and not "by the way". I get to the gate and they starting to ask to check the carry on bag, and the funny part is that they didnt weigh any of those bags. I decided to ignore the situation and just wait for boarding, My nightmare didnt end, my seat was next to the exit so the attendant was explaining to us in spanish the rules and  when she finished she ask if we understood. I am Asian but my maternal language is spanish, I replied to her yes in spanish. She looked at me and repeated the whole thing in English again and I said, I speak Spanish so I know what you meant. She stared at me like 5 seconds and kept repeating the whole process in english so I just ignored her and closed my eyes, she woke me up and asked me again in english if i understood. The whole experience was horrible and disrespectful.	0
Los Angeles to Bogota via Mexico City. It was the worst experience I had with any airline. The customer service is the worst. Due to their bad service and lack of interest to help anyone, I missed 3 flights my total travel time was 33 hours instead of 16 hours originally planned. This occurred during my flight from Los Angeles to Mexico City and Bogota. This airline, never offered any help to accommodate me with a hotel during the delays. I really needed to sleep. And I wasn’t able to sleep at all during this ordeal. Not even food vouchers were given. I arrived ill due to the lack of sleep. This is something the consumer must be aware before choose an airline. The savings are absolutely not worth the painful experience.	0
Lima to San Francisco via Mexico City. I've traveled on many airlines and have never experienced such horrible customer service. The airplanes are old and decrepit .I had to use the restroom on a flight from Mexico City to San Francisco, it was an emergency. It was during the time they were serving drinks. Mind you, this has never been a problem on any other airline. They simply ask me to move into one of the isles- they push their cart and I can easily go by. This time, the rep told me to use first class. I was okay with this but the way he ordered it was obnoxious. I rushed all the way back (they were very close to the end of the plane). As soon as I walked into first class the most pretentious women I have encountered stopped me, and told me to go back and use the restroom reserved for my class!  I told her the other airline attendant had told me it was okay to use this bathroom. She literally backed me up into my area and shouted at the other airline attendant that no one was allowed to use those prestigous golden bathrooms. The original flight attendant finally made the room he could have made from the beginning and I was allowed to use the restroom. I have never been more upset on a flight. They had the cheapest prices and they are the worst.	0
Frankfurt to Athens. I am very disappointed in the service of Aegean Airlines. On my flight to Athens from Frankfurt I had to pay an extra fee of 60 euros to check in my cabin bag exceeding the weight limit by 2kg. I was not the only one getting this treatment. Not that the bag would have been bigger in volume than the one allowed, only it wasn’t the correct form but would have still fit the overhead compartment just fine. Also a couple of people who had bought tax free products at the airport and now had to check in their bags because the extra plastic/paper bag they were carrying also had to be in their cabin bag . The service onboard was standard and the flight arrived on time, all of which I couldn’t enjoy after the experience I had at the gate.	0
Rome to Athens. I pre booked my seat. It was close to an emergency exit. However I did require a seat belt extender. Instead of the matter being dealt with discreetly the air hostess as loud as she could said she cannot allow me to sit there if I require an extender because it means I am not fit. No that's not the case. Regardless she then proceeded to as loudly as she could going to every person in rows behind me asking if they are alone and are willing to swop seats because I am too big to sit by the emergency exit. I have never been treated in such a disgraceful manner by an airline. To top it off I was skipped when food and drink was being offered. I will never travel this airline again.	0
Dublin to Chicago. I was one of the unfortunate customers that was on the EI125 flight May 2nd. We were diverted to Milwaukee due to thunder storms in Chicago and the Captain and crew tried to keep us informed as much as they could. We sat on the runway in Milwaukee for 3 hrs waiting for the storm to pass but at that stage the crew could not fly it to Chicago so the deplaned us and we were told we would be looked after in the Terminal. When we got in there was one gentleman telling us they were printing forms with our options and he was going to collect the rest of the people off the flight. We never saw him again of Aer Lingus staff. We were left in the terminal to sort out our own arrangements.  I have been trying since yesterday to find my bag that was on that flight. I have been flying Aer Lingus for years and this is the worst experience I have had -  over 200 people in a terminal and not one Aer Lingus person to take care of them?	0
New York to Phuket via Beijing. Do Not fly Air China. I had read the bad reviews but chose to ignore them, boy was I wrong! First we missed our connection in Beijing due to Air China not landing or deboarding on time. We circled the airport for over 45 min then they didn't let us out of the flight for another 30+min. Because of this we missed our first day of vacation and we weren't able to stay at our first hotel. After being given the run around via multiple emails and phone calls, they refused to compensate our room. Then on the way back they delayed our layover over 4 hours, with no explanation! I've never experienced such flippant customer service. If I could rate them a zero I would!	0
London to Bangkok via Beijing. Do not ever fly this airline. Not only were my flights delayed, but my luggage was lost for several days, with Air China taking absolutely no responsibility, except for the first day on which they told me that the place was unbalanced so they took my suitcase off.  Unhelpful aircraft staff, even had an argument in the aisle in front of us, shouting!	0
Bangkok to Frankfurt via Chengdu. The worst flight I ever had. Air China is not even able to check through the luggage although the flight was booked from BKK to FRA. I had to immigrate into China - had to get a transit visa. I asked the Air China staff for assistance: Their answer: we have more important things to do. The ground service of Air China is not even existing - if at all they are able to speak a foreign language, like English, which is mostly not the case. The service onboard is better with the exception of the food that is inedible. My advice: never fly Air China! The flight price may be cheap - what you get for it is not worthwhile.	0
Victoria to Toronto. Extremely disappointed with Air Canada Rouge, and feel like we were tricked into using this carrier when booking our trip on Air Canada's website. Major complaints were that the seats are extremely small with no cushioning or padding, I'm a size medium woman, about 170lbs, 5'8" and I barely fit in the seats, my knees were definitely in the back of the poor guy in front of me. Also, on a 4.5hr flight, we were offered water/beverages only one time, and it took over 2hrs to get the drinks going because they were so slow to move their way through the plane. I wish they wouldn't offer the charged snacks/meals because it really makes the service extremely slow. Line-ups for the one washroom were epic, they allowed about 10 people to line-up at once so we were constantly being elbowed and stepped on as we barely fit in the seats and armrests are so tiny. Service from flight crew was okay, but they were more concerned with gossiping in the back then providing water and comfort to their passengers. Flight crew was constantly announcing in French and not English and was loud. Rouge player didn't work. Bought a $40 wifi pass that didn't work.  Dreading our next flight, also with Rouge unfortunately. Wish I could get a refund. Don't book with them!!	0
Bogota to Toronto. There was no Spanish speaking staff on the flight. I had to translate for the passenger seating beside me. The crew spoke a lot over the PA about things that were not important (creating memories, and other irrelevant information) and did not provide information like length of flight, temperature on arrival, etc. The pilot never greeted the passengers with information about the flight. They have an app for their entertainment system and the choices are outdated and extremely limited. There is no radio option to listen to varied music. The flight left in the evening and instead of offering a dinner, they offered a breakfast. I was starving when I went on board and I was offered only a candy bar and chips. Nothing till around 4 hours after and it was a breakfast choice. The ground crew were extremely disorganized on check in and boarding.	0
Montreal to Barcelona. The seats are quite uncomfortable and there is little to no leg room. When my girlfriend and I sat down, we noticed there weren't any screens on the seats. This came to a surprise, however, the staff informed us that there would be wifi on board to watch tv & movies during the flight. After takeoff, we inquired about the wifi and that it was not working. It was only then that they had mentioned we needed to download the app before takeoff, however, we could rent an iPad for $10 - although $10 is minimal in comparison to the cost of the flight, it's kick in the gut if you ask me. After dinner was served at 10:00pm, we would expect that the lights would have turned off. This was not the case. The staff did not dim any lights until 12:00am, and they proceeded to turn them back on at 2:00am to serve refreshments and breakfast. There was no personal overhead airvent, and it was left up to the staff to turn it on and off. I found myself cold, needing a blanket one minute and then so hot I'm sweating the next. I will pay the extra money to avoid Air Canada Rouge in the future.	0
Boarding processes excluded priority handling for Star Alliance Gold pax. Departing flight was delayed, causing an impossible connection for my onward journey. Upon arriving at YUL, deboarding was delayed first to cool the engines, then because the gate was being shared with another flight from the USA which had been given priority. As I was eager to make my connection, an Air Canada attendant suggested that I run ahead. When I did that, I was met with a gate agent who started yelling at me. They insisted that I return to the plane (which I did), they proceeded to take my boarding pass away and threatened to file a formal complaint against me even though I had followed the guidance of the Air Canada attendant. The gate agent continued to berate me in front of other passengers. After finally boarding my connecting flight, they did not manage to deliver my checked in items. The special (VGML) meals I was served were farcical in standard. The airline charges for everything on its domestic routes, and after paying for headphones the entertainment unit did not work properly or have full seasons of shows (only two or three episodes per season).	0
On the day of our flight, Air Canada moved us out of our preferred seating that we had purchased, without our permission. We were informed at the departure gates that the refund would be automatic since the change was made by Air Canada, but we have yet to receive any refund. Instead I had to apply for a refund, which will take up to 45 days. At the gates when I asked to change back to my preferred seats, I was told that I had made the change myself, the system had moved my daughter to a regular seat because she did not have a K-eta. Both reasons were preposterous. First, my daughter and I were travelling together. She is a minor and there is no reason why I would separate her from me so that she would sit in a regular seat among strangers. Second, when I said that I did not make any changes to the seating and that I had paid for the preferred seats, the staff at the counter then said that it was the "system" that did it. The story went as follows. We did not get a K-eta three hours before the flight, and therefore the change was made automatically. I also did not have a K-eta, but I was not moved automatically. By moving my daughter to a regular seat did not make her more able to travel to Korea without a K-eta. Regular or preferred seating, one needed the K-eta. I also learned that in the meantime they had sold the preferred seat to another woman. I asked that my daughter's seat be reinstated because we were the original buyers of the seat. I was told that since I could get a refund for my daughter's seat but not the other lady (she had used up her refunds), they would not reinstate my seat. As a result of Air Canada’s actions, both my daughter and I were inconvenienced with the regular seats while the other lady enjoyed the preferred seat at our expense. In other words, Air Canada has placed the other woman’s interest over ours. Is this their corporate policy? They then took 20 minutes to sort out the seating. I was suggested the last row of the plane, just in front of 4 toilets and the food preparation area. There was no other choice given to us unless we were prepared to be separated. I did not want to create a scene at the departure gate as we were already in the last hour before the flight. I reluctantly accept it because not to do so would cause further inconvenience with our travel plans. The seats turned out to be terrible and experience of the flight was excruciating for both of us. During the 12 hours flight, there was constant vacuum flushing of toilets, strong food smells emanating from the preparation area, a male crew member who talked non-stop in a loud voice, and a hysterical crying baby whose parents decided that the back of plane was a better area for her to calm down. Both of us did not get any sleep during the 12-hour flight. All in all, it was a flight from hell. The reason why we chose to pay for the preferred seats was to avoid the problems of being assigned to bad seats. However, Air Canada did not honor its contract with us. We had entered into a contract to fly on the preferred seats and Air Canada had unilaterally cancelled our contract.	0
Bangkok to Moscow 9 January 2015 flight 273. Awful customer service experience. The Aeroflot customer service team promised that they had found extra leg space seats as requested for my wife (dislocated her knee). When on board we found that they were not only normal economy seats but in fact were exactly the same ones that we had reserved previously (before her leg break). So not only was service unacceptable but also the staff seem to have > deliberately deceived us at the customer service and check in desks. I assume to move us on without having to do anything else. So they let the company down and of course passed the problem on to the flight attendants who also did nothing much to help. Very poor indeed.	0
Cancun to Los Angeles via Mexico City. This was the airline from hell. My flight from LAX to Cancun was canceled less than 24 hours before taking off because they were "no longer operating" and I couldn't get on another flight for another 6 hours from the original after being denied many times, a supervisor agreed to book another airline. When I landed in Mexico City for my connection the supervisor said it wasn't her problem and I needed to book another flight so I paid an extra $200 to get to Cancun to make the wedding I was going to. On the way back I had booked with The same airline again unfortunately & when I arrive to the airport they tell me my flight is overbooked! How is that possible when I paid for it? They put me on standby and tell me there's nothing they can do but give me food vouchers or airline vouchers. So she tells me instead of my 11am flight I can leave at 1:20 instead but my connecting flight in Mexico City won't leave till 720pm! So I ended up spending entire days in airports because of their stupid excuses and they gave me a "MasterCard" I can't even activate LOL because I have to call an international number & when I called the airline they told me I need to email customer relations - I thought I called customer relations! This is by far the worst airline and customer service I've ever encountered!	0
My husband and I were flying from Mexico City to Shanghai. The plane from Shanghai to Mexico City was extremely uncomfortable in economy class (by the way, do not pay for the emergency seats, they are the worst seats,) so we decided to upgrade to Premium economy to better our seats (around $6,000 pesos more). When we checked in at the airport, we were charged $1,800 Mexican pesos extras for 3 extra kilos as apparently Premium economy means nothing. You won't get any sort of benefits whatsoever, so if you are reading this, just be aware about the luggage requirements and avoid checking in your carry on. You will not find any sort of helpful staff neither at the airport nor via phone to help you understand, clarify, or reinburse any money regarding this issue. We bought the tickets thinking they were a good deal, at the end, we ended up paying way more than if we had bought a more expensive tickets through a different airline. I do not recommend this airline at all. I am a very dissatisfied customer and we will certainly not fly again through Aeromexico.	0
Return sector from Taipei to Frankfurt via Shanghai-Pudong, including an overnight layover in Shanghai. Check-in staff in TPE to my surprise told me that my suitcase cannot be checked through to FRA as PVG is "not an Air China hub, unlike PEK". Since the check-in staff did not work directly for Air China, I did not make a direct complaint, but this must be mentioned when booking a connection itinerary. The assumption when booking this kind of flight with both legs operated by the same airline is that bags will be checked through to your final destination! This meant that I had to clear customs and haul my suitcase into central Shanghai for the less than 24hrs layover. Furthermore, the transfer visa staff at Pudong was very rude. I did not have my full itinerary printed in this electronic day and age (just my confirmation number written down) and immigration staff insisted on seeing a copy of my onward journey (as I also didn't have my boarding pass for the onward flight because TPE staff could only check me in to PVG). No Wifi is accessible in Pudong Airport to travellers without a Chinese SIM card, meaning I was unable to access my booking on my phone/iPad, unbelievable! This meant that the immigration staff had to physically go to Air China to check the passenger list for tomorrow to see if I'm on it, making me wait 30 min at the counter. Service onboard is below average and smiles seem faked. The food and drinks offering is substandard with none of the alcoholic beverage offerings on other carriers. My IFE touchscreen was very hard to navigate (touch function almost broken), meaning that pausing a film when going to the toilet was not possible easily. Film selection very limited, outdated and often in Chinese. Advice: Avoid Air China stopovers like the plague, however tempting it might seem to explore Beijing or Shanghai! And avoid Air China in general if you have other choices. It's definitely worth spending an extra 100 bucks for service and comfort (especially since my layover costs amounted to this much anyway).	0
Beijing to Geneva. As Lufthansa and Swiss codeshare with air china, I was unfortunately booked on the return flight with Air China. Firstly they have rude customer service, the flight attendants make you feel that they are doing you a huge favour if you complain. I initially received an email saying that my flight type, had been changed from business to economy. When contacting Air China, I was informed that I would be flying with Air China, however there would be no flight miles on this sector. This is a joke, given that the ticket from Geneva to Xiamen and return cost CHF4400. I had selected the seat numbers during my booking and the seat numbers were clearly indicated in my flight itinerary. However, on my flight from Beijing, we were issued different seat numbers and I did not make a fuss since it was a late night flight and all i wanted to do was get back home. I did not have anything to eat, and fell asleep shortly after take off, I could not get the seat to recline 14A, but thought this was because I was tired. Later on about 2 hours after take off, I again tried with no success. Then i tried to switch on the TV, and called the flight attendant multiple times, they reset 4 times without any success. I approached the manager and initially he tried to refer me another flight attendant to assist. I refused his referral and insisted that he resolved the problem for me. He then informed me that he would try to reset the tv again, and would try to get the seat to recline. By this time it was about 6am in the morning, as we had departed 2am Beijing time. So no chair that reclined, nor a tv that worked. Feeling very frustrated i called the attendant again and told him that this was unacceptable. During all this time, I kept getting these looks, as if to say what do you expect us to do? Finally, he relented and said he would see if he could find me another seat, this was almost 5 hours later. From the onset, why didn't they just suggest this. All the passengers were asleep and i informed him that i didnt feel it would be right to wake the rest of the passengers. I changed 3 hours prior to landing, as I had a terrible backache, but will never fly with this airline again. Small seats in business class, tine screens if you seated in front seats, and more importantly nothing that works. So in effect i could have flown economy as i basically received the same kind of seat and very little assistance from the staff!? Even, my written complaint to the airline had fallen on a deaf ear. This is my first and last time flying this airline. This is the worst airline I have flown with and will refuse to fly with them again	0
We flew from Vancouver to Panama City, connecting through Toronto. Flying with AC Rouge was everything but a good experience. Their planes are quite antiquated. On the A321, from Vancouver to Toronto, the USB plug was not functioning and the seat wouldn't recline correctly. The seat pitch is ridiculously small. Don't expect a snack or a blanket. The light was on for the 5 hours of the red eye flight. The entertainment system needs serious revamping. Hardware is old and not responsive. Poor content doesn't help the touch lag or the offset discrepancy. On the plus side, the staff on that flight was very friendly. The flight from Toronto to Panama City was worse. There's no screen in this A319 configuration so we were asked to download a 80 MB application which proved to be useless since the wifi was not working. There was USB plug to charge your device anyway so you don't know if your phone wouldn't die in the middle of a movie. No snack was offered. Last, the staff was not so friendly.	0
Boston to Venice via Montreal. Our flight was delayed out of Boston and we ended up missing our connection. After a complete lack of information in Montreal we waited in line for an hour for what we though was rebooking our flights but turned out was just to issue us vouchers for a hotel and informed we had to call to change our flights. Missing our connection meant we lost a hotel in Venice and our train tickets the next day to Rome. There was a flight directly to Rome for less money that AC refused to put us on because we didn't book that flight. The Boston terminal is small, and has poor air conditioning.	0
My flight was delayed by more than 12 hours and they did not uphold the Canadian Air Protection rights I was deserving of. They were suppose to provide us with accommodation since it was an overnight flight and the delay was more than 4 hours, but they told us “we don’t offer that service” and we had to spend the night on the airport floor. I have had flight delays before, but I have never been treated so inhumanely. Please, please, pay a little more and go with a better airline.	0
Cancun to Vancouver via Mexico City. Boarded our flight from Cancun to Mexico city with no issue. Boarding our Vancouver bound flight, and this is where it all went to hell. As usual with Aeromexico, boarding started late. Flight was delayed by about 20 minutes because of it. However, when refuelling the plane, they miscalculated and had to start all over, delaying the flight even longer. After they finished we got the whole safety video and pre take off information, but we hadn't left the gate yet. Look outside, it's pouring, thunder, lighting, hail. It didn't look good. After about 40 minutes of no information, I got sick and tired of it, so I confronted the cabin crew to make some announcements, which they did eventually, in Spanish. Remember, this was a Vancouver bound flight, most people spoke English. After about three hours of little information, little water and no food, they cancelled the flight and deplanned due to bad weather and a fuel related issue. We all thought, well great, at least we will get a hotel. Just getting our exit tickets took about an hour because there were only two gate attendents trying to help over 200 angry passengers. To make matters worse, they said they wouldn't rebook us and we'd have to figure it out ourselves. They gave us a local number to call, only problem, we didn't have local cell phones. Sick and tired of the gate attendents only speaking Spanish, we went to the check in counters to try and rebook, only to find a giant queue of confused passengers. Turns out, the airport cancelled all their flights that night. So we stood in the line and about an hour and a half later, we got our new tickets for a flight in 2 days. To make matters worse we still had to collect our check in bags and find a hotel. 3hrs later, we got our bags and went to Aeromexico to find a hotel, only to learn that they will not be compensating is because the delay was weather related. Mind you, the captain told us the delay and cancellation was due to the fuel misshap. No matter what we said to their "customer service representative" they wouldn't budge. We were forced to spend two days in the airport with our bags and fellow passengers who also got screwed by Aeromexico because by the time we finished this while rebooking thing, all the hotels were sold out by other airlines. Every staff member we witnessed was nothing but rude to us. Also, the vast majority don't speak a word of english. Being an international airline, I would think speaking English would be important. I highly recommend not choosing this airline unless you want to be stranded in Mexico city with no fresh clothes, beds and food for two days.	0
Vancouver to Nicaragua via Mexico City. I've flown many different airlines and never experienced one as bad as Aeroméxico! Constant misinformation, horrible customer service and surprise fees! I Will never fly with Aeroméxico again. I was charged $188 each way to carry my surfboard! The max I have ever paid on any airline previously being $50.	0
Mexico City to New York JFK. I was shocked by the horrible, unprofessional, incompetent way that I was treated by Aeromexico during my recent flight. Their deception, misinformation and incompetence cost me 8,612 extra pesos! I should not have been treated this way. I arrived at the Mexico City airport in the early morning, hours before my flight. I checked in at Aeromexico's check-in desk. The clerk checked my printed ticket and my U.S. passport and confirmed them. I asked if there was anything else, and she said no, that I was good to go. She checked in my suitcase and gave me the receipt for my checked-in bag. Then I went to my gate and waited several hours until boarding. When boarding began, I stood in line and eventually reached the front of the line, expecting to be checked in and board the plane. The Aeromexico employee at the gate asked me for the stub from my Mexican immigration papers, which I signed upon entering the country. The Aeromexico clerk at the baggage check-in had said nothing about this stub when I asked if there was "anything else" I needed. When she indicated that there wasn't, I placed the stub into my suitcase, which she then checked in. The clerk at the gate told me not to worry, that all I'd need to do is go to the Immigration desk and sign another immigration stub. She told me to sign it, then come back to the gate — that I could then board at the gate with no problem. That turned out to be a lie — or at least, radical misinformation. At her direction, I ran to the Immigration desk, signed a second immigration stub, and paid a 500 peso penalty, then sprinted back to the gate, returning just minutes after I had left. Suddenly the clerk at the gate had completely changed her tune. "Sorry," she said, "plane's leaving. You can't board." I reminded her that she told me to go get the second immigration stub, return to the gate, and that I'd have no problem boarding the plane. The clerk brushed off my concern like it was of no importance and returned to chatting with a fellow employee. Upset, I went to the Aeromexico customer service desk. The clerk there told me not to worry, that this was no problem at all. "There's a 9:05 am.flight to JFK," she said. "Just go to the Aeromexico desk at L2 or L3, ask for the manager and have her switch you to that flight. It will be no charge."  But this turned out to be a lie too. I should have known something was up because the clerk refused to tell me her name.  When I sighed, she told me again: Just go to L2 or L3, talk to the manager, and get the free reassignment. "It's just a little bit of paperwork," she said. So I went to L2 and waited in line for 45 minutes to see the manager. When I got to the front desk, the clerk there said that if I wanted to get on the next flight, there would be a penalty - a 8,112 pesos. That's $453.65. "It's Aeromexico procedure," they said. In the end, I spoke with 8 Aeromexico employees, but none helped, including the customer service help line. They told me they had no power to process customer service matters.	0
Orlando to Dublin. They cancelled our return flight home and left us stranded for 5 extra nights. Directed us to their website which didn’t work. Spent over 6 hours on the phone and got “disconnected” over 12 tines. Was directed to go to the airport and they sent us away. The worst customer service imaginable. They are only after their bottom line and could care less about people.	0
The flight from Dublin to Lyon was rescheduled from Friday to Saturday due to bad weather conditions. On Saturday we had to leave at 11.40 in the morning. We waited 9 hours in the airport and in the end our flight was deleted without any reason. At the airport there wasn't the snow anymore and lot of flights left during the day without any problems, including Aer Lingus flights. I'm asking for compensation but I can't for bad weather conditions as this is not true. The assistance was very bad at the airport. Very bad experience.	0
I warn you do not fly with Air China, it's not worth the cheap prices. I normally don't give complaints because I always try to find the silver lining in situations, but I will this time. Though Air China had some of the best deals, it's only a good deal if everything goes smoothly. I ran into lots of trouble on this trip, and it ended up costing me much more than if I had flown with a more reputable company with better customer policies. I ended up paying lots of money for a very frustrating experience, not even able to take my trip after all. First of all, when I checked my E-ticket, it said the airlines was in "Terminal I" Once I got to Terminal 1, I found out, it was the wrong Terminal! The "I" of "Terminal I" stood for "International." Because of that I missed my flight. To rebook the flight, I was charged about $300. Shortly after rebooking, I found an error in my ticket. To correct the error, it cost me another $200. It also took a period of 5 hours to get all of this sorted! I was on an off the phone with them and had to call them back several times for emails they promised to send me but hadn't. I had my layover in Beijing Capital Airport. Thirty minutes after de-boarding, I realized I left my passport in the airplane seat pocket. After notifying staff (telling them my seat number too), they said they couldn't find it. (Which turned out to be false - several days afterwards, I received a call saying my passport had been found in the seat pocket) I thought they were talking to each other trying to figure out my passport situation. So that's why I followed them and once I realized what was happening, it was too late. They forced me through the security check and back onto an airplane flying back to Japan cause, "If no passport, no be in China!" they shouted at me. Once home, I called Air China to voice my complaint. It took about 2 hours. Rather than taking care of the problem themselves, they kept referring me to another number. In the end, I was fortunate enough to talk to a caring and reasonable agent. But they said there is little that can be done. I spent thousands of dollars, just to have 24+ hours of one frustrating experience after another. I understand that part of it was my fault but also, doesn't everyone make mistakes? I feel Air China has no mercy helping customers with their troubles instead, seems they prey on the problems as a way to bring in more income for themselves. I definitely do not recommend Air China!	0
Los Angeles to Xian via Beijing. Worst airline ever, our flight was canceled minutes prior to boarding and there was no communication. I approached a staff member and was told there was a slight delay and should be boarding soon but when I turned around to look at the plane it was gone and still no communications to the passengers. 20 minutes past boarding time the plane disappeared from the gate and still no word was past to the passengers. 1 hour after the boarding time the staff suggested we reschedule our flight, a suggestion and not notification we had to. finally after an hour and a half past boarding time we were told to follow a staff member and once we got about 100 feet from the counter the staff member disappeared leaving us lost on what to do. We returned to the ticket counter and was told to collect our luggage and to come back tomorrow to re-book the flight.	0
vNagoya to Vancouver. First time flying Air Canada Rouge - will never fly them again. Our leg over to Japan, we flew Air Canada, but Rouge on the return. The bulkhead section leg room was very cramped. My husband is 6'3" and that is why we upgraded to preferred economy and paid extra to sit in these seats, we anticipated much more leg room, you couldn't even stretch out your legs at all, we would have been better with a regular seat. The dinner was disgusting. Have attached a photo, but not even sure what that dark rectangle thing was in my food, it looked inedible. The breakfast sandwich was disgusting. The seats were so thin.  There were no TV screens in seats, but you could rent an IPAD for $10, I did not need to rent, I had my own. The movie/tv selections were from years ago and not that many options to choose from. And the wifi connection was poor, took several attempts to get the app to open and load the movies. No charging ports. Flight attendants. I had 2 kids behind me that kept kicking the seat. Finally I called a flight attendant and asked if they were traveling unaccompanied, (because I didn't see and adult) I explained what was happening and she looked behind me and said, "They're going to sleep now" - not they are not, they were just kicking my seat. They did it again later and I just turned around and gave them a look...they didn't do it anymore. Overall this was the worst flight ever, domestic and International. Air Canada Rouge, you have to do better....much better!	0
Kelowna to North Bay. Staff was good and flight service was pleasant. My beef is with the seating and lack of entertainment system. The seats are so close that anyone over 5.5 ft tall is jammed in like a sardine. Finally after 5 flights I was able to get the Rouge player to work on my wife's note book. The movie selection is poor and it's much more cumbersome than the in seat players from before. This was my last Rouge flight.	0
The interior appeared to me as if not updated since the 1970's, there is no built-in entertainment systems, and the food/drink service was horrendous. They have a wifi entertainment system accessed through personal devices however, this never worked and numerous people questioned the crew regarding the system and were told the system doesn't work when there are too many people on board.  On an 8.5 hour flight, dinner was a small chicken dish and breakfast was a piece of bread. Alcohol is not included with meals when I asked for a full can of ginger ale I was told "We don't give the whole cans." When I then finished my ginger ale and requested another one, I was told that I would have to wait until the cart came back around in a couple hours. My return flight was even longer, the entertainment system didn't work, and the service was poor.	0
Upon arrival from Cleveland, I began my layover until the scheduled 10:05 Pm departure. However, by shortly after 6Pm they were already warning of what turned out to be constant further delays until a scheduled 12:25 the next day. They began boarding us shortly after the rescheduled departure delay. We sat in a very full plane on the tarmac until actual departure at 2:47 Am. During the entire series of delays both in the airport and on the plane Air Canada gave us nothing including no reason for the delay. Their response to my complaint is that the reason was unscheduled mechanical problem of undefined nature.	0
We were travelling from Cancun, Mexico to Boston USA, via Toronto , Canada and there was 6 hours lay over in Toronto (YYZ). Our flight was at 9 pm from Toronto to Boston, the incoming flight was showing delayed and supposed to arrive at 9:52 pm from New York but they were showing our flight was on time till 8:40 pm then suddenly announced flight was cancelled due to weather which was outright lies. They just can not blame the weather to avoid taking care of the passengers when flight between our destination was taking off and landing albeit with some delay. On top of that uncivilized staff and threatening passengers	0
We flew from Atlanta through Toronto to Calgary on March 5, 2023. Our first flight was delayed well over an hour and the second one was 1.5 hours (almost all Air Canada flights delayed). There were no weather issues or other explanations offered to anyone. Also, while attempting to check-in online we realized they had not seated us together even though we had booked these flights 2 months prior. The only way to get seated together online or at the airport was by paying a seat upgrade fee, per person, per flight. Air Canada counter person also forced me to check a bag even though my luggage met the criteria for carry on. On both flights we noticed many others around us also separated from each other so among ourselves we moved around til everyone was seated together.  We were also bumped from our second flight since an earlier flight had been cancelled, causing us to take a later flight and arrive home 1.5 hours later (at 1:30 am). I realize extreme patience is needed to travel these days but Air Canada makes travel a nightmare.	0
By far the worst airline experience I've had. 3 of my 5 flights were delayed, causing me to miss several hours of my vacation, and eventually the final leg of my trip. The gate agents were rude, and refused to answer even the most basic question. My new luggage, purchased brand new at my destination and marked fragile, came back broken and looking as if it were a decade old, it's contents destroyed. I found the food was basically inedible.	0
Guadalajara to Monterry. We had the worst experience with Aeromexico with our flight from Gaudalajara to Monterrey on 23rd July. In the airport we were faced with a huge line to check in and it was moving incredibly slow. We only had to check in our baggage as we had already checked in in the system. There was no baggage-drop line. After we had queued for more than an hour and we finally reached the counter, the staffer demonstrated the worst service I've ever experienced. It turned out that our two suitcases each exceeded the permitted weight limit on 23 kg with 200 grams. It is normally not a problem, as I in two seconds relocate some of the content from my check-in suitcase to my hand baggage but they refused to let us do so, unless we went to the very back of the line. This would mean that we would miss our flight. Instead we had to pay MXN 1800 each (ie in total MXN 3200) for the overweight.  It is a significant off-market and burdensome condition not to be allowed to repack the suitcases in order to comply with the allowed weight limit. We will never use this airline again!	0
San Antonio to Puerto Vallarta via Mexico City. The lack of customer service is why I will never fly them again. We had originally booked our trip on March 2, 2017 and picked our dates and flights based on the family budget for our vacation. In May we received notice that the return flight was cancelled and come to find out there were no flights with them back at anytime that day. So we could either fly back with someone else and we could stay another day. After looking over the options the cheapest was to stay another day. I understand that this can happen, but with any other airlines they would try to compensate the customer because of the issues. After trying to contact them, found out that in order to get an answer the only option was through email with a 5 day response time. As a group we were just hoping that they might at least pay for our baggage since it would not cost the airlines extra money and it would help us by paying some of the cost we were having to pay out. By the time they finally answered it was to say no, but that they were sorry and really hoped to get our business back. We have flown with other airlines and they moved our flight by 15 minutes and gave use $25 vouchers that could be used for future flights or our baggage. So even with all of this we went and when checking back in, the website would not allow us to add baggage to 4 of our guest as it showed they already had paid baggage, so we add the 2 extra. However, when we got to the airport, it only showed the 2 bags. So now instead of the $20 we have to pay $25. However, when we went to pay because of the currency exchange we had to pay $30 and they were not willing to honor the $20 we would have paid because of their website issues. This does not even cover that the plane looked as though it was going to fall apart at any moment and since they do not seem to do compensation you would think they could pay for upgrading their planes.	0
Quito to New York via Mexico City. Aeromexico refunded my ticket without letting me know and for no reason. The night before my flight, I received an email from them to check in online, so I did not suspect anything was wrong. Upon arrival at the airport, I was told that my ticket had been refunded and was therefore no longer flying with them that day. I asked why and they couldn't give me an explanation, no one knew why. When I told them that I had received an email from them just the night before, the customer service agent told me, "Well maybe if you would have checked in online we would not have refunded your ticket." He then suggested that I fly tomorrow, which would cost three times the original ticket. After an hour of talking to multiple people, they told me I would be able to fly that day I just had to pay for the ticket. However, their machine would not accept my credit card and I could not take out an efficient amount of money from the ATM to cover the cost, and they refused to take a card over the phone from a family member. So I was unable to get on the plane, and had to re book, which I did so with a different airline.	0
I am so disappointed to have to write this review of Aer Lingus. I fly regularly with them 3-4 times per year, but now I will have to reconsider. I had no success in trying to change the date of a return flight, despite availability on the return flight I wished to avail of. I called the company and they refused to do it over the phone. In addition, I tried through their online system which would not permit it. At this point, the service experienced was highly frustrating. Having wrote to "Guest Services, which is their inappropriately branded customer complaint department, they provided me with a three line vague response that didn't correspond to my complaint in any way. I found this experience bordering on arrogant. Having returned an email to them outlining this, they chose not to reply. I tried to engage the company on social media, no reply either. When I had a great experience with Aer Lingus about two years ago, I wrote to the company outlining how grateful that I was. At that time I had backspin and they upgraded my seat to accommodate me. Within hours, I had received two emails from the company about how delighted they were. On this occasion however, there wasn't a word from the company for five days after my email was sent, and the customer services rep on the phone was short and unwilling in any way to help me. I will not fly with Aer Lingus again!	0
Shanghai to Melbourne. Was due to fly from Shanghai to Sydney on Qantas recently but due to mechanical issues we were placed on an Air China flight instead. It was horrific from start to finish. Rude and unhelpful check-in staff, rude and abrupt staff at gate, flight attendants were not friendly and avoid the food at all costs as it looked very old and re-heated quite a few times. The seats were very uncomfortable and the plane was an old and dirty one. The only small thing I was grateful for was that they had a very limited choice of movies in English which at least passed the time. Even if I was offered a first class free ticket anywhere on Air China I would decline. Do not use this airline at all.	0
This was my first flight with Air Canada rouge and the worst flight experience. We boarded the aircraft facing an over 8 hour transatlantic flight. Shortly after boarding, the flight attendant made an announcement that there is no running water in any of the lavatories. Also, there were no IFE monitors in the seat backs. Passengers had the option to rent an ipad for an additional $10 or download their app and watch on your own device. This had to be done prior to boarding.  Naturally, hundreds of us were trying to download at the same time. Therefore, it took a very long time, just to realize that the movie selection was sparse and terribly outdated.	0
Our flight was scheduled to leave at 8:55pm but we got delayed until 10pm due to bad weather, then it was canceled. The staff was unpleasant and practically shooed all of us across the airport to customs. We finally got a rebooked flight for 7:50am the next morning. We reached the hotel at midnight and got little to no sleep. Bottom line, the service was horrible and their crew need to return to school. This was my first and last time flying with Air Canada. I purchased their Wi-Fi, it took more than half the four hour flight from Vancouver to Toronto for it to start functioning.	0
Excellent flights both ways with Adria Airways from Manchester to Ljubljana. Staff friendly but unobtrusive. Leg room far better than most economy flights, seats comfy and plenty of storage space. Flights on time, quick and efficient boarding and disembarking, smooth take offs and landings. All in all a very pleasant experience.	1
Two short hops ZRH-LJU and LJU-VIE. Very fast on CRJ 90. Seats comfortable and crew was fine. Ground services good and lounge was quite nice.	1
Flights from LJU to ZRH and back all on time. In Economy class was served just coffee tea an water but it's fine for one and a half hour flight. Very friendly and helpful cabin crew members. Very clean and comfortable cabin on CRJ900 aircraft.	1
London Gatwick to Ljubljana and Ljubljana to Vienna in Business Class. Delayed slightly at Gatwick but that happens. Otherwise very good flights. Cabin crew friendly and welcoming ensuring that you were okay - without being too pushy and forward. Short flights and light meals/snacks served.	1
Domestic flight Accra-Tamale. 1hr flight. One time in both directions. Water, juice and snack (fish or meat pie, savoury biscuits) provided on this short flight (more than you get on BA domestic/European flights three days). Friendly and very polite cabin crew. Marvellous captain who gave great information about the flight. Joint venture between Hainan Airlines (China), Hahn Airways and Ghanian investors. An excellent service which makes domestic travel much easier in Ghana	1
Santiago to Buenos Aires. Excellent. No problems at all. Will fly again. Great staff at both airport and plane crew, clean aircraft, comfortable seat for economy class flight departed on schedule and arrived 10 minutes before.	1
My first experience with this regional airline on a short hop from Point-a-Pietre to Melville Hall. Very pleasant and relaxed flight, nice staff and decent leg and hand luggage space. Will be happy to fly with them at any time again.	1
Excellent flight, good service with hearty meal (starter main course dessert tea and coffee) Duty service on board. A generous pitch for economy class seats. Note the delay at departure due to the closure of Orly airport and the flights diverted to Paris CDG.	1
Paris to Algiers. Very good flight, excellent catering, clean plane, but crowded. The cabin is spacious for a 737, room for the legs, comfortable seat. Very good meal for a 2 hour flight. The crew is listening. Only complaint, the windows were dirty.	1
We flew business class (club condor) from JFK on Feb 21 and returned on Feb 28. Great experience. Airbus 330-200 was clean and comfortable. Both flights left on time. Crews were first-rate. Great bargain. Highly recommend it.	1
Flew four times over the course of a month internally around Argentina (EZE-El Calafate El Calafate-Trelew Trelew-EZE EZE-Iguazu) and was very happy with service. Check in was prompt and staff were friendly and bilingual. Never experienced any delays in fact we were actually moved forward from a 6 hour change at EZE to a flight departing 5 hours sooner for no extra charge. Snacks and drinks served in all flights and despite the 737-7 seats being noticeably more cramped and less comfortable than the -800 I'd certainly recommend.	1
Travelled from Madrid to Buenos Aires in May as the starting point of my South-American holidays. Reasonable prices and a remarkably good service all along the flight. There was a wide range of food to choose including delightful Argentinean beef. Check-in was fast and simple and the flight had no delays at all.	1
Even though Aerolineas Argentinas has received too many complaints from customers recently my flight from Sao Paulo Brazil to Buenos Aires Argentina on March 1 2014 in Premium Economy Class was great and I have no complaints. The flight was on schedule the flight crew were polite and helpful. Aerolineas Argentinas' premium economy class is the same as most US companies' domestic first class. The seats are J seats very comfortable and the food in this class was also a great sandwich yoghurt and a chocolate muffin. Compared to service in the same route provided by Brazilian companies I have flown and comparing also the price Aerolineas Argentinas Premium Economy class is far better in service and mainly in seat comfort!	1
I took three flights in November. Buenos Aires (AEP) to Cordoba Cordoba to Mendoza and Mendoza to Buenos Aires (AEP). They were award tickets through Sky Team (Delta) points. I was a little apprehensive after reading the comments here but in my case the flights all left close to on time and the aircraft were nearly new. Seating was comfortable and space was adequate. On each flight there was a beverage service and small snack box.	1
Tucuman-Buenos Aires-Tucuman. Two good flights the first on a Boeing 737-700 departed on time and arrived 15 mins early. Flight service is efficient and cabin crew very friendly. Totally recommended.	1
Buenos Aires-Iguazu Falls return. Two good flights the first on a Boeing 737-700 departed 10 mins early and arrived 15 mins early. Flight service is efficient and cabin crew friendly. The return flight on an MD-88 old but in good condition quiet and comfortable with a friendly and helpful cabin crew with the flight arriving at Aeroparque (AEP) 10 mins early.	1
Salta-Puerto Iguazu domestic flight operated by Austral. Flight a Embraer 190 with personal entertainment with TV series and documentaries and some CD's. The entertainment system failed twice but the crew reactivated it quick. Did not expected entertainment on a domestic flight. The crew offered a sandwich with a drink. Good legroom at emergency exit but the normal seats also offered good legroom for this short flight of 1.5 hrs. Departed 2O mins early and landed 40 mins early in Iguazu.	1
I have travelled several times with Aerolineas. Buenos Aires-Rio De Janeiro and Montevideo. Domestically I have flown between Buenos Aires and Mendoza Cordoba and Salta. I only have praise for the staff and organisation of this airline. I have encountered polite efficiency from check in staff and air crew the aircraft were clean and I experienced no delay or problems with the flights.	1
Best airline in Russia! Very nice staff, comfortable seats (I don't ask much, I mean this is coming from a girl who drives tanks), good service and power supplies, anything you can possibly ask for, enough room for my single bag, and even more room. Great service, good crew, wonderful meals, and so much more!! Ground service, I was pushed around a lot, but that isn't the staffs' fault. I don't remember turning on my in-flight entertainment system, I was too busy playing World of Tanks Blitz with the incredible WiFi.	1
I was very impressed with the staff. Many thanks to the Aeroflot representative Nina at Larnaca, who was extremely professional, friendly and genuinely caring for her passengers. The cabin crew were outstanding as well, especially the flight attendant Asiya and the purser Irina. They did everything to make people onboard happy.	1
London to Moscow on brand new A350-900. I must say I’ve experienced one of the best business class hard products in the world. Amazing suits with doors, featuring a huge and easy to navigate IFE screen with lots of movies and music, super comfortable lie-flat seat, lots of storage space, and great touches, such as a personal wardrobe, and a locker with a mirror. Staff were amazing, food was good (although I think Aeroflot still has a room for improvement here, especially if it wants to become a 5 star airline), and ground service was quick and efficient. All in all, Aeroflot’s A350 is definitely above and beyond any competition from other European carriers.	1
Had a really nice flight with Air Arabia. Great seat pitch, comfy seats and easy process all the way. Cabin was perfectly clean and crew sufficiently attentive. It was my first time on Air Arabia but it will not be the last	1
Aeroflot refunded fully the ticket costs by clicking only only button. The process was easy and fast. My flight was not cancelled it’s just due to the new quarantine rules in the country of arrival I had to cancel the ticket. I was surprised and please to see how easy and fast the refund process is. Other airlines offer vouchers or refund only 30% of the ticket price whereas Aeroflot did it  on their website and refunded the full fare paid. I am very pleased with the service and would be happy to book again.	1
Lyon to Moscow via Delhi. Fantastic customer services. I had a cancelled flight with another operator so missed my long haul, called the free helpline and the service was excellent and every easily resolved. I have flown a few times with Aeroflot and have always been very surprised at how good and easy the customer services are. Thankyou	1
London to Dubai via Moscow. I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for the service provided from staff when buying our ticket at Heathrow Terminal 4. The service is second to none. When we got to Dubai was brilliant as per your advice, we are welcomed from the immigration and no trouble at all. We cannot thank you enough and staff at Heathrow are an assets to Aeroflot. Definitely will visit Moscow next time with your company!	1
Seoul to Busan. First time with Air Busan and it was great. Price, App, check in, employees, service,luggage and on time. At the check in I was offered an earlier flight, no fee. There were no problems with this airline and trip. Recommend.	1
CPT-GBE GBE-JNB. First flight a clean Bae146 in very good condition half empty with loads of leg room. Food excellent for an airline and service find. Second flight on an equally clean ATR72 with equally good snacks. All flights on time. Much prefer them to SAX or Airlink!	1
My family flew to Daegu from Gimpo. From check-in to boarding, service rendered by all staff were efficient and excellent. Cabin was clean and seats were usual economy class comfy. On our return flight from Daegu to Gimpo, we were late due to traffic and could not check-in thru self serve kiosk. We had barely 15 mins prior to flight departure. Approached counter staff for assistance. First thing the staff did was radioed the Captain while processing the checking in and printing of boarding passes. An agent came over to escort and assisted us throughout the procedure to ensure we boarded the plane without further delay. All these were completed within 15 mins and flight departed on time. Our biggest compliment is towards the Captain for both flights. Journey was smooth and landing was perfect which you dont even feel the plane has landed. Flew with many major top 10 airlines in the world but never had this landing experience ever before. Cabin Crew rating, great and comparable to top airlines! Keep it up and will definitely choose and fly Air Busan on all my destinations where served by Air Busan.	1
Fantastic Service. Booked from Australia for Jo'burg to Maun flight. Kept great communications for any changes and even transferred me on a SA flight no extra charge for my Kasane-Jo'burg leg when I explained about connection time with my Qantas flight due to schedule changes without having to be asked and emailed me back a new booking. Great service nice snack on a short leg clean modern plane on time friendly ground staff. I hear things might have been different a few years back but certainly my experience was very good and would fly with them again.	1
In August Johannesburg to Maun and Kisane to Johannesburg. Both flights were spot on time. Service on board was fine with drinks and light snacks served for the roughly 2 hour flight in each direction. Aircraft's were in good shape and the seats comfortable for this type of trip. Check-in in Jo'burg was easy and very quick. Check- in in Kisane was a breeze as the airport is tiny. All in a good experience and a great way to enhance your Botswana experience.	1
We were in Jeju flying to Busan then connecting to Gimpo. I noticed our flight was delayed and we may miss the connection. I queried this with ground staff. Within 16 minutes our flights were changed (at no cost), 4 people's luggage located, dragged across the airport, by tiny female ground staff, identified and reloaded then we were seated in row 1 of the airline and off to Gimpo. Totally amazing. I am still astounded that this happened. Plus a refund on our original flight. Congratulations Air Busan. If I could I would fly this airline regularly - customer service appears to be top of their list.	1
What a nice little airline! Air Astana provides economy passengers with a surprisingly generous amenity bag which was a nice touch. Cutlery was real metal (rare in economy!) The food was really good and the staff were friendly. This is how an airline should be run! Well done guys.	1
It was an amazing experience on all the 4 flights with Air Astana (IST-ALA-DEL and DEL-ALA-IST). Seats were very comfortable with enough leg space. Food was fresh, delicious and filling with lots of options (if you book pre-meal). Airline staff was exceptionally helpful and caring, they were just a bell away. Definitely value for the money.	1
I experienced exceptional customer service from the ground staff who checked in our baggage was professional and exceptional customer orientated. Not only she helped with our special request (which she could easily deny as per rules and which required an extra effort from her side) moreover, she went beyond that. She send an email to the Air Astana representative in Georgia asking for assistance, which we never asked for.  She even accepted a slight extra bag weight and wished us a pleasant flight. Airbus 320 Neo - nice aircraft with comfy chairs. Good selection of movies, would be cool to have some podcasts though! Overall flight was good, rest of the staff did well also.	1
Paris to Phuket via Moscow, economy class, Dec 4th 2019. Frequent Flyer with Aeroflot for nearly 3 years now, all I can say is that I'm fully satisfied with them. Swift priority check-in and security check in Paris via dedicated lanes for Frequent Flyers. Lounge access. Fly Attendants very welcoming, helpful and genuine. Space + seat (front row) and economy seat with good width (18') and pitch (32') - Aeroflot is one of the very few Airlines to still give 18 inches width (most nowadays give 17" or less). Moscow Airport is quite good, the various lounges for Frequent Flyers / business passengers are really excellent. Arrived on time and relaxed to Phuket. Had only once in 3 years a delayed luggage (was delivered 48 hours latter to my door in Paris, free of charge to me). Overall an excellent Airline and I strongly recommend Aeroflot.	1
Gimpo-Jeju and Jeju-Gimpo. One of the best budget airlines I have flown with thus far. Air fares were cheap. The seat was really comfortable for such a short distance and legroom room was really spacious (more space than SIA). Beverages were served despite the short flight and FAs were very friendly. Airport staff very polite when we were checking in. Definitely fly with this airline again in the future.	1
I recently flew Gimpo - Jeju and Jeju - Busan and what a great experience! Fares were cheap included baggage and when I changed my flights to spend more time in Jeju I only had to pay the fare difference. The seats were the same pitch as Qantas (31") flights departed close to schedule and drinks were served despite the short flight time. The only slight criticism I have is that their website is a bit tricky parts of it rely on Flash which may be why I couldn't get an English version to load on my mobile device also whenever I tried to put my passport details in I got an error - if this happens try selecting "No passport" this worked for me. I'll definitely choose them again if I'm flying their routes - great effort!	1
PUS-CJU B737 Short flight from us an to Jeju Island. Left and arrived on time. comfortable seating. No food served; just a 50cc bottle of water handed out. No inflight entertainment.	1
Thoroughly enjoyed flight from Nur Sultan (Astana) to Frankfurt with Air Astana Sunday 14th Feb 2021, I was travelling from Almaty to Frankfurt via Astana. First leg economy, second leg business. The service on both flights was very good and the food and drink outstanding. Tasty sandwich on the first domestic leg and given plenty of choice and excellent presentation of starter and main course on the international flight. Good Job Air Astana.	1
I have been using Air Astana on various domestic and international routes for 15 years. I have seen great improvements in this time from the early days. Not only in the quality of the aircraft and facilities but especially in in the cabin services. My recent flight this month highlighted this. Though I travelled economy I found the cabin staff very attentive and helpful. They were polite and supportive and prompt with any requests. The food was excellent, it was breakfast but hot, tasty and filling. The amenities packs are now eco friendly. They contain all those items that one requires on a journey of 3 hours or longer. They look good too. It was a new aircraft that was very clean, with comfy seats and was equipped with an excellent entertainment package. My only concern was travelling during these difficult times and the flight was full, understandably with the reduce number of flights scheduled. The in cabin safety brief, which is excellent and worth watching in all three languages, has had an amendment to relate to the latest pandemic requirements. The cabin crew enforced these rules without fear or favour in a very polite and professional manner. Keep up the good work Air Astana, you are my favourite airline.	1
Almaty - Saint-Petersburg is my favourite route. Flight was on time. Aircraft was brand new A320NEO (2 months old). Service was excellent, food was very good, choice of beverages perfect. Now airline using eco packs for amenity kits and it looks so good! And also inside of the kit they even put neck pillow, because flight was longer than 5 hours.	1
I was flying from Prague to Cairo via Moscow, the staff are professional and nice, good value for money, food was nice , cabin was clean, Aeroflot improved a lot.	1
FUK-PUS return on an aged 737-400 clean and offering reasonable leg space. Check-in courteous despite I arrived pretty late. No inflight service for such a short flight they served orange juice but it was not necessary to do so if fares go lower. They have an interesting selection of duty free shopping on the plane it's worth trying it. Uneventful trips and luggage arrived safe and sound. I'd wish they offered more routes into Korea from Fukuoka. Very user-friendly website that allows to catch good fares and per it's seat selection. Flying BX was a nice surprise.	1
Very good considering the fares. I even wonder when they serve drinks on a 50 minutes flight (Seoul - Pusan). I'd rather have a cheaper ticket.	1
Very good friendly and uncomplicated service. Like the fixed prizing. Makes you wonder why it has to be so stressful travelling in Europe with the likes of Ryanair etc. Would always choose Air Busan again.	1
Flight from Moscow SVO to Paris CDG, approximately 3 hours long. Hassle free boarding. Very attentive cabin crew. Clean cabin. FAs kept working with passengers throughout the flight. The seats are wide and comfortable, uncomparable with pitiful masquerading of business class by other European airlines. Full scale lunch: scallops with cucumber spaghetti and salmon with wild rice were sublime. Grand cru champagne and a variety of wines. Overall impression: very robust high-quality product from Aeroflot, exemplary for other European carriers.	1
GMP-PUS-GMP. Very good fast efficient and friendly staff. At GMP ground handling done by Asiana so all the traditional quirks of this great airlines. Served water and OJ on this very short flight.	1
Kuala Lumpur to Almaty. I credit Air Astana for their superior service on a recent flight from KUL to ALA last Tuesday 1st October. The service received on the flight was second to none, where the team leader provided a first class service during the the 7 hour flight. The quality of the main meal, wine and snack was excellent. I know Air Astana has received some criticism in the past but it was one of the best experiences I have had when flying. They made you feel welcome and special from start to finish.	1
Washington DC to Moscow. Very pleased with this airline. In-flight food / service / entertainment was top notch and exceeded my expectations. The aircraft was also new with generous leg room. Thanks Aeroflot!	1
Seoul to Minsk via Moscow. I had a booking that involved two airlines and three layovers, and when I came to check in in the city of origin, it turned out I needed a visa to make the first layover. A visa I didn't have. Aeroflot (the second airline) agreed to take my luggage from the first airline so that I wouldn't need to go through passport control and pick up my luggage and then check in again to continue my journey. I will never forget their kindness. Moreover, on the second leg of my journey I had a problem with my ticket (bought through the agent, not from the airline) and the manager Andrei in Seoul check in desk went the extra mile to call the agent on my behalf and try and solve the problem, and in the end helped me to buy a new ticket all the way being calm, supportive and professional. The more I fly Aeroflot, the more I feel secure that I will always be taken care of.	1
Kuala Lumpur to Almaty. I would like to express my deep gratitude to the crew of KC936 at the 25th August for their good work in conditions of prolonged turbulence. The stewardesses, in spite of the shaking, carried out the service, organize food and drinks. The food was excellent. Service was on top! Thanks to the pilots and the entire crew for the excellent flight.	1
Just flown Dublin to Alicante. Couldn't find a fault. Very pleasant staff on ground and in the air, but I still think hold luggage costs are are pure theft.	1
Vladivostok to Moscow. Very pleasant surprise, one of the best flights I've recently had. Aircraft was a bit dated but very comfy with a decent legroom. Being 6'3" i didn't find it uncomfortable on 8 hours flight. The food is great, drinks selection could be better but nevertheless was OK. Toothbrush as well as slippers and eye-masks were provided which made the flight much better.	1
Nur Sultan to Shymkent. Extremely nice experience. Food and drinks served on short flight all included in the ticket price. Cabin crew very friendly and professional.	1
Aegean Airlines will remain always my first choice and my favorite airline. The best Airline in Europe without any doubt. Cabin crew are so helpful, patient and supportive. Please keep up the excellent work and I hope that Aegean will make long haul flights soon.	1
Moscow to Athens. Aeroflot seems to be one of the very few remaining airlines to offer a real business class product with special seats in short haul flights. Service is refined (I was even offered a tablet with films downloaded ) and you really feel the difference compared to the usual slightly improved economy class product. All this at very competitive prices . Congratulations Aeroflot.	1
Long family flight with 9 month old baby. Great flight. Thank you very much for your excellent service and attention to infants! We flew with a baby from Madrid to Bangkok with a transfer in Moscow. At all stages the staff were friendly and very caring towards our kids. Docking time in Moscow was only 1 hr 20. In the transit zone we were actively driven up and let everyone forward among a huge crowd. Very carefully as all half asleep thought slowly. I want to note separately that the quality of food even in economy class is at a high level and not some kind of plastic like many airlines have. If coffee then only natural not instant and cheap Nescafe. Tasty tea. I often fly and I have something to compare. All kids are given packages with toys - this is very nice! When we flew from Moscow to Bangkok the stewardess herself offered to transfer to the free lane where there were no seats in front which turned out to be much more comfortable :) At all stages of the flight there were modern and comfortable aircraft. Clean and well maintained at a low cost. Aeroflot - you are just super!	1
St-Petersburg to Istanbul via Almaty.  A21 neo for both ways with Recaro seats,comfortable for 5-6 hours flight. Food was perfect, especially from Istanbul. Good choice of beverages.  On the way to Istanbul I over slept my dinner, but I got it after and the coffee was hot. In Istanbul new airport I had to visit Air Astana kiosk and I got  qualified assistance there! Other flights Saint-Petersburg to Almaty, from Almaty to Astana and back to Saint-Petersburg were very good.	1
I had a fantastic week of holidays in Hurghada and to review a hotel is a must but I also think it is very important to acknowledge the airline which makes it all happen by bringing you over and back in safety. I flew with Air Cairo for the first time there and back after a week and both flights were comfortable and I felt very welcomed. The staff both on the flight on 24 June (Prague to Hurghada) as well as on 1 July (Hurghada to Prague) were friendly, smiley and professional. At one point there was strong turbulence and the staff were supportive. Next time I fly to Egypt I will go for Air Cairo.	1
Sharm El Sheikh to Amman. Perfectly smooth check-in process, our car seats for the kids were handled without fuss. One bag was 23kg but was not a problem. Contrary to some other reviews, our carry on bags were not weighed. We had a 10kg limit in any case. Staff on the flight were very pleasant. Although only an hour-long flight we were given beef shawarma - extremely tasty. Would use them again.	1
Dubai to Almaty. Overall impression is great. Flight attendants very attentive and nice - food is good. Entertainment, since I am traveling often, variety is limited for me. Renewed in two months, not enough. Some some standard business class seats, but I would prefer to Beijing a bed seat, it is night flight.	1
Almaty to Astana on an early morning flight in economy class. I was impressed by this aircraft which still feels very new inside. Inflight entertainment is available at each seat (with a USB port) and there is a good selection of programs. The flight attendants were nice and professional, good info from the pilots and we arrived to Astana with no delay. Overall a very nice experience.	1
Almaty to Astana. Consistency of ground service, food, cabin service and inflight entertainment are core values of this airline. Sometimes I push myself to have connecting flights to the destinations where they have no direct flights.	1
This journey was 6 legs long with Air Astana. Saint-Petersburg to Almaty, from Almaty to Ust'-Kamenogorsk and back, Almaty to Aktobe and back, and finally from Almaty to Saint-Petersburg. If my trip from LED to ALA is usual thing almost two times a year, but my new discovery was domestic flight KC863/864 from Almaty to Aktobe. Oh my god, even choice of hot meal dish. Other stuff just have to mention : clean cabin, perfect meal each way. I also had my air astana's mug I got last year. It's capacity is about 400 ml and asked to fill it up with coffee: "no problem, sure!“ I heard the answer! My flight from Ust'-Kamenogorsk was delayed, but I got notification by e-mail 4 hours before departure, so I was still at home. 6 flights and only one delay. I think it's good factor. overall: everywhere I saw attentive staff, helpful managers and perfect service.	1
Casablanca to Lisbon. I found this airline to be much better than expected. well cleaned aircraft, friendly flight attendants. On schedule too. Very comfortable seats. They sould increase their flights to Portugal.	1
Amsterdam to Atyrau. I am a regular user of Air Astana for work purposes and have been for over a year now. I had never heard of Air Astana before so I was very skeptical to say the least. What a mistake that was. I would put Air Astana right along big international carriers. The on board service and food are excellent the flights are on time. The cabin crew are very professional and language skills are excellent.	1
Best Airline in Europe, professional cabin crew, smiley and helpful. Receiving updates about my flight all the time. The thing that might really need an improvement is the FQT program (Miles + Bonus) , they must be more flexible in transferring and receiving points from other Airlines.	1
I travelled from Sharjah to Colombo on Air Arabia in June. The flight was full but I was comfortable. The flight was about four hours long. I checked in online but my phone failed so got replacement boarding pass at baggage drop. I enjoyed the flight and will fly them again.	1
I flew from Beirut to Sharjah on Air Arabia. Check in was easy as I did it on line. I showed my boarding pass on my phone to get through security. At the gate I changed my e boarding pass to a paper ticket as that was required. Although they loaded a lot of cargo we took off on time. I had three seats to my self and was able to sleep. I was given water and dates which were very nice. I will fly them again.	1
Frankfurt to Bangkok via Astana / Almaty. Air Astana was way more than I expected. Check in was super easy and the cabin service is great. The food, drinks and entertainment make long flights easier. They took amazing care of me when flights changed but I had an important appointment and they moved things around for me to get me back in time. They also put me up in a great hotel where I was also able to go explore Kazahkstan for a day! I will definitely be looking for flights with them again.	1
Great airline! I fly regularly with Aegean Airlines, and it is always my number one choice. Especially the new planes are really nice, and the service on board is good too. The food is really not that bad, especially in business class. However, Economy is great as well. There are some nice touches with Aegean, like how they inform you when your flight is delayed. They email you, and you get a notification in the app. About the app, it works really good. One of the best airline apps I have tried so far! I don't have any complaints. Even after dozens of flights, no problems at all!	1
Stansted to Ajaccio. Excellent all round. On time, drink and a snack served, no hassle to board or have onboard bags. Seats were comfy for a 2 hour flight - fare reasonable. Would recommend.	1
On September 4th 2015, we had reservations to fly Air Corsica from Calvi to Nice. Then we had connection on Alitalia to Rome. Our connections were very tight with only 45 minutes in Nice. Weather on September 4 created much confusion. The Air Corsica flight from Nice to Calvi was delayed 1 hour and arrived at 10:45am. We were going to miss our Nice to Rome connection. We expected to be staying the night in Nice. We departed Calvi 1/2 hr late. Fortunately, the flight from Nice to Rome was also delayed. The Air Corsica agents in Calvi arranged for an agent in Nice to assist in having my wife and I meet Alitalia agent. That agent escorted us through security to our gate and we made the Nice/Rome connection. We arrived in Rome only 1/2 hour late and all of our bags (4) arrived perfectly.	1
Stockholm to Tokyo via Moscow. Great experience with hard working crew and great punctuality. Many people say Aeroflot are a fraud and that it’s a bad airline but these people are totally wrong since they have changed totally from their past and now it probably is the world’s most underrated airline company. The crew was amazingly polite and kind but the one of the only issues was the cabin temperature was too hot on the way home (Tokyo-Moscow) but at least they listened and did what they could to make it better unlike many other companies who would have totally ignored it. The food wasn’t the best either especially when the plane originated from Moscow but from Japan it was way way better. I would definitely recommend Aeroflot and would love to fly again with Aeroflot in the future!!	1
Almaty to Kuala Lumpur. My family and I travel with Air Astana and are accustomed to a high level of service provided by the airline. During a flight last week from Almaty to Kuala Lumpur I witnessed a crew have to respond to an emergency medical situation about an hour into the flight. The professionalism of the Captain and Crew in handling the situation resulted in saving the life of a passenger. Medical emergencies can happen to anyone and at any time. Having experienced the crew's actions first hand I am confident that my family and I are in safe hands with Air Astana.	1
Moscow to Delhi via Almaty. Moscow to Almaty on a new Boeing 767, with personal entertainment screens and mood lighting. Staff accommodating and professional. The meal was delicious with metal cutlery. Wine and beer were complimentary (no spirits on the menu, though), and extras were served with no frowns. IFE was one of the best I experienced, no lag whatsoever. One weird thing was that the screen by design could not be adjusted when the seat in front was reclined, so the viewing angles could be uncomfortable. We were given outstanding amenity kits with neck air pillow, slippers, pen, some hand cream, eye shades and ear plugs. Different coloured kits seemed to have slightly different content, so make sure to collect them all. The crew passed the cabin with drinks several times after the meal service. Seat comfort was okay, nothing outstanding. Almaty to Delhi was on an older A321, with no personal screens. The seats were very comfortable with great seat pitch and traditional "thick" profile of the seats. Cabin crew were lovely and the meal was even better. There were some amenity kits given as well, except a bit smaller ones (which makes sense on a 3 hour daytime flight). You could access their entertainment via your own device and onboard wi-fi for free with no issues, and the selection was impressive, but the lack of power ports meant you will run out of power quite soon. Delhi to Almaty was practically the same as the flight from Almaty to Delhi. For Almaty - Moscow I have made a bet to upgrade on their website (the lowest amount possible), and we were upgraded to business. The flight on a Boeing 767 was wonderful with lie-flat seats, lots of privacy and space, great IFE and pleasant cabin. The cabin crew were very accommodating, greeting us with champagne as a pre-departure drink, and the purser greeted us by name, making sure we had a fantastic flight. Meals were delicious, each course was brought separately. If I could think of any improvement in business class, it would be alcohol menu, because there were just one type of champagne, one type of white and red wine (plus lots of spirits and cocktails). I believe the wine card can and should be improved. Their Bloody Mary was perfect, by the way. Almaty airport is an absolute disaster - it's small, crowded, with nowhere to sit or relax, no decent cafes, everyone is shouting at everyone. Even in business class lounge there is nothing to eat or drink for free, which is just a disgrace. Our luggage made it, and the flights were on time, though. To conclude, I recommend Air Astana, and the economy experience is outstanding, but I will try to fly via Astana next time, since Almaty airport is just so awful.	1
The best airline in Europe, professional cabin crew, comfortable seats and excellent service. It was a pleasure to fly with you. Keep up the good work and wishing you all the success.	1
St Petersburg to Ust-Kamenogorsk via Almaty / Astana. Clean new cabin, perfect meal each way, especially from Astana. I have to mention that food cooked in Kazakhstan always better than from other airports. Wide choice of beverages. Good schedule : short connection in Astana on the way back to LED. KC TV app very useful and its good thing for flights no longer than 5 or 6 hours and cabin not equipped with personal entertainment system. Service unbelievably attentive. Absolutely recommended.	1
Astana to Dubai. It was very nice family trip from start to finish. Everything about the flight was perfect, quick check-in, boarding, quality of special meal, reservation of seats and comfort, kids amenities, entertainment system, cleanness of cabin. I would only recommend to provide wifi access but cabin crew informed me that internet is available on some flights. Since I flew with my daughter of 4 years old I had things to do and hadn’t had a chance to enjoy internet anyway. Crew is very positive and i have been individually welcomed as a Silver member. Overall it was very memorable flight and I would recommend Air Astana!	1
Aegean exceeded my expectations. Didn't expected a snack and few drinks service on a few hours flight. I asked one extra beer when we started our descending and the crew handed out one with a smile. Way more better than other European airlines. I really hope they will earn five star airline status.	1
Smooth check- in procedure at a very busy Athens Airport. Polite and efficient staff on hand to assist. Boarded a clean and shiny A321 Neo, greeted by smiling and courteous crew. Full flight, on time departure, usual high standard of onboard service. Good and clear PA announcements from cockpit in perfect English. Toilets were very clean. Landed early, bags arrived on belt without any issue. Thanks Aegean, great flight and highly recommended.	1
Great daytime flight from Shanghai to Oslo via Moscow SVO. Despite some apprehension from other reviews regarding bags going missing at SVO transfer, everybody and their bags arrived earlier than scheduled at the final destination. Transfer from SVO Term D to E was a quick walk and uneventful. A well supplied lounge at Term E was quiet and relaxed during the short transit time. The cabin crew were friendly and helpful with perfect English language skills and the meals above average, with four main course options on offer and each was tops. Plenty of wine/spirits were available during meals and the flight generally. IFE was well stocked and adequate for a 10 hour flight. The lie-flat beds were not tested on this occasion.	1
Moscow to Bangkok economy class. Moscow Airport is good and the check-in was swift, via Skypriority  lane for Frequent Flyers. Recent Airbus A330. Flight Attendants welcoming and helpful. Was not offered a Space+ seat with extra legroom)although my GoldMember status entitles me to it - but I was offered a Space+ seat on the first segment from Paris to Moscow. Seat comfortable, with good width and legroom. Large choice of movies, watched 3 during the 9 hours flight. Dinner, then breakfast, both good in quality and quantity, and the Flight Attendants again perform very well. No more ice cream between meals, unfortunately. Arrived to Bangkok relaxed and right on time. Was offered a Priority Immigration Swift lane - very appreciated. Overall a very good experience and I strongly recommend Aeroflot.	1
I have had to recently use some other airlines and this has reinforced my appreciation of Air Astana’s cabin services. Air Astana has set and manages to maintain exceptional high standards of service. Al the cabin crew appear to have fundamental English skills. The new uniform is fresh and professional. The safety video has been improved and is actually pleasant to watch even after many flights in a short time frame. The new aircraft have screens on the backs of the seats and passengers can select their entertainment. The new earphones are great and I always keep the set. The passenger pack is in a useful bag and the products inside are good but I miss the mini-biro pen. The food and beverages are of good quality with a proper cutlery. I have found the cabin crew to be attentive and responsive to my needs. Depending on the airport I have boarded check-in staff may not have the same consistency but my recent check in at Atyrau was good (this is not usually a friendly airport though there are some exceptional individuals working there). I would say without fear of reproach that Air Astana is my preferred airline of choice.	1
Frankfurt to Berlin, our first flight was cancelled but they arranged me other flight. Next day I use Air Berlin also this time their service was on time and good service and cabin crew - they are very friendly and helpful. I was very happy their service.	1
Almaty to İstanbul in March 2018. There was no delay on flight. I remember smiling crew faces for that trip. There was delicious food and good entertainment for 6 hours flight. Note: wishing to see bigger planes for such a long vayage.	1
Antalya to Almaty. I write to commend staff on an exceptional level of service when I traveled with Air Astana on the 23 May. The service I had was a superb experience throughout the flight. I trust that you will pass on this recognition to the specific staff members from this flight.	1
Tashkent to Almaty. Excellent food, high tech inflight entertainment via their application and on time. Although flight was only for one hour thirty minute crew was attentive. The only thing I would feel to improve to make announcements shorter since all are in three languages.	1
I am frequent flyer with Air Astana. Almaty – Dubai is the best available option.  The check in procedure at the business class counter works smoothly without any problems. Business lounge at Almaty Airport is not good. Boarding is OK, still some airport problems, not enough jet bridges. The seats are comfortable for a five hour flight if it is not a night flight. The catering is perfect, flight attendants are very attentive, beautiful smiles. The entertainment program is OK, we are provided with iPad in business class with good choice of the video programming. Internet is missing on this type of the aircraft.	1
Unfortunately Air Berlin has gone broke, but they are still flying. I was a bit apprehensive because of the insolvency and the bad performance earlier this year, but despite the situation it was great: very punctual - even half an hour earlier on the inbound flight, nice crew and comfortable planes. Since Münster/Osnabrück is a small airport, one is at the gate within 5 mins of entering the building and boarding is very quick. On both flights we had an Air Berlin plane, a Niki flightnumber and a TUIfly crew. B737 showed its age but was fine. Paid 7 euros for a currywurst. A bit steep but it was excellent. Nice flight over Cologne and Lake Geneva with view of the Alps. I was out of Palma airport within 20 mins after touch down (only hand luggage) which was very good for such a big airport. Big surpise on the inbound flight: I was assigned an emergency seat for free. The normal cost is 25 euros, so this was very comfortable. We even got the famous AB chocolate heart at leaving the plane. It's a pity AB is about to disappear. I have flown quite a lot with them and it was always fine. The only reason I don't recommend them is the insolvency, because they're suspending flights already.	1
Almaty to Astana. The early morning flight allowed me to have the whole Sunday I could spend in Astana. We had a good breakfast in the aircraft. This year I enjoy my Silver Nomad. Despite of the downrating I was happy to know that Nomad Club members start to enjoy better scoring of points. Now we are 3 times quicker to collect the points necessary for the new tier or bonus ticket. Nomad Club develops well and I appreciate it. This weekend I will have my next flight to Almaty to enjoy running at Almaty Marathon that is also supported by Air Astana. As usual I expect good service from Air Astana that keeps me being a loyal client.	1
Almaty to Kiev. Very good experience on this flight. The crew was very attentive and helpful,  and plenty of legroom considering we were on a 6 hour flight on A320. Amenities were great and they offer everything you need to enjoy the flight.	1
My employer was stuck for 2 1/2 hours in the Toronto Pearson Airport because of a delayed Air Canada flight headed to Athens, Greece last evening (June 16th, 2022) due to understaffing of airport personnel and consequently would miss his Athens (Aegean Airlines) connection to Mykonos on the other end. I call Aegean's customer service in Athens and spoke with a lovely gentleman, Avgoustis. Avgoustis was calm, reassuring, patient and found me the best possible solution to get my employer on a connecting flight to his final destination (Mykonos) in the shortest time possible. He kept me calm! I really hope that someone will recognize this gentlemen's exemplary customer service.	1
This was the first trip I tried Air Berlin's (then) new business class service for Europe. I was really pleasantly surprised. This is in my view a much better product than LH or the likes offer. I like that you can get any food or snacks you want from their trolley at no extra charge. This is much better than getting a pre-set tray with food you have no idea what it is. Air Berlin also had very nice hot towels. Their staff really like what they do. The only minus is that they are expensive.	1
Moscow to Yekaterinburg. The flight time is 2h30min, I like Aeroflot's A320 seats, all types. The new one, are the best one, they have iPad and phone holders, power outlets etc. But this plane was 8 years old, but the cabin looks like it is new. On this 2:30 flight, you receive sandwich, candy bar, an apple and drinks (tea, coffee, different juices, and water) All is nice. Cabin was clean and crew were super-friendly!	1
Brussels to Moscow. Not my first flight with Aeroflot. And each time I'm surprised by 5-star onboard service: very polite and attentive flight attendants, always an extra attention for passengers with kids, on board beverages are foreseen for all class passengers, even on very short flight (from Bru to SVO: soft drinks and juice, fresh salad, scone, cheese, butter, bread, warm and very tasty meat or poultry dish, side dish, dessert, tea or coffee - all is tasty en fresh! This is just to compare the ticket of other EU companies who will not serve you anything unless higher class and so much more expensive ticket or on board extra purchases for snacks, and not a full meal). Fleet is super new, clean, again if compare with EU famous airlines. Looks like their high standards of service just grow and do not drop. Concerning the arrival and departure times, all is on time. Even if delayed at a/p of departure due to airtraffic of other (not by Aeroflot depending reason), the arrival time will be same! I can only advise this airline, perfect!	1
Excellent flight. This was quite different from the outbound KL-Almaty 10 days ago which was delayed 6 hours. The biz class is configured in 1-2-1, so every pax has his/her own aisle. The bed is flat at 180 degree (unlike the Air Astana 757). The service and food were excellent. While the TV screen was big, the choice of movies could have been improved. Air Astana, after the incidents with the outbound flight delay (Almaty - KL), you have redeemed yourself thanks to two of your very dedicated managers in the Kuala Lumpur operation. In addition, your b-class product in 767 is also way better than that of 757.	1
Excellent service from Air Astana team. A very pleasant flight of just under 4 hours flying from Moscow to Almaty. Service was exceptional and the crew very attentive. A very smooth flight and pilot was very careful with manoeuvres. Overall I was very impressed with this airline and felt very safe.	1
Tehran to Tashkent via Almaty. At the moment I am in transit at Almaty airport (not the best airport to spend the night) but Air Astana pleased me on the flight from Tehran to Almaty. It is the first time I have flown with this airline. Excellent, punctual, well turned out crew. Polite. Clean toilets. Amazing service.	1
