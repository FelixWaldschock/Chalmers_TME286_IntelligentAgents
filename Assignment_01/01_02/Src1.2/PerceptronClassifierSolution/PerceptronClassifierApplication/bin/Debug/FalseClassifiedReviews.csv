 disgraceful airline and an absolute shame to canadian standards . i had a simple 1.5 hour direct journey from boston to toronto . this UNKNOWNTOKEN into a nightmare that lasted about 12 hours . two of my flights from boston to toronto in the morning were cancelled , thus missed my connection at noon with another airline ! rebooked flight was from boston to montreal to toronto of which both flights were delayed by over 1.5 hours . if you are looking for punctual and good service , look elsewhere please !
 UNKNOWNTOKEN one way . a very bad experience . check in was a mess ticket incredibly expensive for what they offer . excess baggage 10 euro per kilo . on board you have to pay for everything and very expensive . plane was old and not very clean . legroom was a nightmare and seats uncomfortable . and the most UNKNOWNTOKEN crew very rude and not smiling .
 prague to toronto . violin cruise line booked my sister and me on air canada from prague to toronto . little did i know that the flight was on air canada rouge that doesn't have UNKNOWNTOKEN UNKNOWNTOKEN and expects one to know that one must fly with their own ipad and headphones plus download the air canada app prior to takeoff . they mention UNKNOWNTOKEN the app but i did not realise it is mandatory to do so to be able to watch movies on one's cell phone or ipad until one is in the air and it is too late ! (unless you wish to rent their ipad) . it was nearly 9 hours in a seat that did not recline with discount beverages and lousy meals .
 london gatwick to toronto with air canada rouge during august 2016 . this was a very poor flight . there many UNKNOWNTOKEN . first , there was no inflight entertainment at all . we were told that there was inflight wifi but this did not work . very disappointing on such a long flight . the food was also poor and the announcements on the UNKNOWNTOKEN system were frequently UNKNOWNTOKEN . but by far , the worst aspect of the flight was the very limited legroom available . i am over 6' tall , and i UNKNOWNTOKEN to find a comfortable position throughout this flight . on a long 8 hour flight i would have expected more room . i have flown many times with other carriers and have had adequate leg room on longer flights . i have also sometimes flown on short european low cost airline carriers with more legroom than this , and they are much cheaper carriers . what is surprising is that we flew a much shorter connecting flight (just over 4 hours) from toronto to victoria bc with air canada and had all the facilities that i described above . so why did air canada rouge not provide a better service for the much longer leg of the journey ? i don't like to sound so negative and would not give negative feedback easily but this carrier were very poor value for money .
 lost luggage is a major problem for air canada as i learned the hard way . lost UNKNOWNTOKEN bags , huge line at copenhagen airport of other air canada customers who similarly had lost luggage on multiple ac flights . what is most disconcerting is the number of large carts of lost luggage labeled with dates going back up to a week in full public access that had not even been touched by ac staff which makes me highly doubt the ac claim that they are doing everything they can to UNKNOWNTOKEN lost luggage with travelers . if you are planning to travel with air canada , my advice is not to check bags right now .
 sunday 21st june , shanghai to mexico city premier class . old aircraft with no inflight entertainment this situation bother me so much . there was also a complete lack of interest shown by the cabin crew in their jobs . very disappointing . the flying experience was not be very good on premier class after i bought an upgrade from economy class .
 super convenient 3 pm departure from delhi . only direct flight from delhi to madrid . excellent legroom in economy class - more than any other long-haul airline i have been on . adequate film choices in english . decent meal , UNKNOWNTOKEN snack - more UNKNOWNTOKEN than ana which i flew to tokyo from delhi last month . absolutely nothing wrong in traveling this airline . asked for a gin and tonic , got two without asking . just don't understand why people UNKNOWNTOKEN this airline so much . it's my preferred choice in economy when possible .
 flew air france from london heathrow to cape town via paris . as an UNKNOWNTOKEN crew member of the UNKNOWNTOKEN vintage , i am UNKNOWNTOKEN of the service onboard which ever airline i travel with . i was most impressed with most aspects of the flight - my first with this airline . the senior cabin crew manager was charming and helpful in the extreme , moving me to a vacant seat that had much more legroom , and also offered me his personal UNKNOWNTOKEN that UNKNOWNTOKEN me to charge my ipad . the seat was just ok , however , as other reviewers have mentioned . the people who introduced this new seat should get UNKNOWNTOKEN UNKNOWNTOKEN , the british vacuum UNKNOWNTOKEN , to have a look as it , as it is not comfortable . plenty of pillows did help though . i am returning in business class , so will report on that in a couple of weeks time . UNKNOWNTOKEN , the transit at cdg airport was seamless , and my suitcase was waiting for me on arrival . well done air france .
 i took a flight from dublin to toronto with air transat over the summer . this is my fourth year in a row with the company and they never fail to disappoint . staff are friendly and the aircraft spotless . definitely value for money .
 beijing to london heathrow , business class . having flown out on thai airways , my trip plans changed and a last minute visit to china meant i got booked onto this return flight . i like china , i know and like the chinese people , but this airline is just unbelievably awful . the lounge in UNKNOWNTOKEN pek airport was so crowded and hot , food absolutely UNKNOWNTOKEN , and i thought getting onto the flight might improve things . no ! my neighbour sat and hacked up UNKNOWNTOKEN for most of the trip , occasionally UNKNOWNTOKEN this into his glass or cup . god knows what UNKNOWNTOKEN he was spreading . the seat was okay , but cabin was dirty and had a UNKNOWNTOKEN and very unpleasant smell . forget the ife as choices are typically chinese limited . after the lounge food offering , it got worse on the flight and truly UNKNOWNTOKEN and smelt like dog food - and this was the western choice i opted for . final elements of UNKNOWNTOKEN was when i walked to the toilet about halfway through the flight and noticed 4 cabin crew (in full UNKNOWNTOKEN spread out fast asleep on some vacant business class seats ! air china is a disgrace to star alliance , the chinese , the airline business at large , and i strongly urge you to reconsider before ever setting foot on one of their planes . (i flew 2 domestic sectors with china southern and they are much , much better airline) .
 i specifically booked my last overseas flight to canada on another airline , hoping to avoid air canada . only after i paid was i informed that the 2nd and longest leg of my flight was operated by air canada . none of my experience UNKNOWNTOKEN any delays or unexpected problems . it was a totally on schedule and uneventful flight . but the service on board is so atrocious . my husband and i , both canadian and totally fluent in english , were constantly amazed at the rude behavior of every flight attendant on our side in economy class . every simple and humble request for normal things like a cup of water , a blanket , were met with UNKNOWNTOKEN and loud UNKNOWNTOKEN . the UNKNOWNTOKEN lady sitting next to me , who was extremely polite , was shocked at every interaction with the flight attendants . air canada flight attendants have UNKNOWNTOKEN become the worst UNKNOWNTOKEN for the country . have flown all over the world with dozens of different airlines for the last 30 years , and can safely say that air canada has the rudest flight attendants i have ever experienced . also , nobody seems to clean the bathrooms even on 17 hour flights .
 UNKNOWNTOKEN return . i have flown this route 6 times over the last couple of months . this is by far the fastest way to UNKNOWNTOKEN from london but am fed up by the last of customer service and inability to transit luggage through svo . the planes from lhr to svo are generally new and clean . onward from moscow the planes are ancient although the business class seats recline flat . the food is always the same - just about edible in business class . out of my last 4 journeys my luggage has been lost 3 times . going to give up with aeroflot and fly korean air via seoul now . via moscow might be quick but the total lack of customer service wears very thin after a while .
 bangkok to lax via beijing . flight from beijing yesterday to lax was unbearable . seats were torture . maybe i slept 2 hours out of 12 . people UNKNOWNTOKEN shorter than i were equally miserable . larger people were UNKNOWNTOKEN the aisle trying to release leg cramps . zero room to make yourself even UNKNOWNTOKEN comfortable . staff had little english and were remote . also air china's connecting flight from bangkok to beijing was delayed til 4:30 a .m . miserable and compressed connecting time to something UNKNOWNTOKEN chaos . over and never again ! !
 flew with family for a vacation in portugal leaving late june 2022 , returning early july 2022 . original itinerary was round trip from newark to lisbon flying via montreal on air canada . on day of departure our flight from newark to montreal was cancelled without any notice . we found out when we went to the airport . initially air canada rebooked us on a flight with another airline , but when we went to check in with that airline we were told their flight was already full . next air canada rebooked us to fly to lisbon via toronto . we arrived in toronto but the flight from toronto to lisbon was delayed and then cancelled at 1:00 am . air canada customer service manager at toronto announced the cancellation and said we were free to make our own hotel arrangements and that we could submit a claim for reimbursement with air canada . eventually we got to lisbon the next day . on the return journey , the flight from lisbon to montreal arrived close to schedule but delays in the airport meant we missed our flight from montreal to newark . once again , air canada announced we could arrange our own hotel room for the overnight delay and submit expenses for reimbursement . air canada booked on a flight to newark the next day with another airline . when we got home , we followed the process on air canada's website to request reimbursement and provided all required documentation (flight numbers , receipts , etc .) . it took 83 days for air canada to respond and inform us that our claim was denied because flight delays and cancellations were due to covid and safety issues and so did not qualify for compensation . when i responded that we submitted expenses for reimbursement based on airport announcements made by air canada at the airport , then came back and UNKNOWNTOKEN our claim was denied .
 toronto to cancun . you often hear of negative stories when it comes to airlines despite the fact that they have to manage thousands of travelers in the course of a day with few problems arising . i’d like to share an absolutely great news story that really shows how above and beyond air transat was in helping my family out when we were in UNKNOWNTOKEN UNKNOWNTOKEN and had given up hope . on friday , january 3rd , my wife , 2 kids , a UNKNOWNTOKEN daughter and UNKNOWNTOKEN son , were supposed to be going to mexico for a week vacation . we arrived at the airport , went through the self serve check-in terminals to get our baggage tags and then moved on to the luggage drop off . following luggage drop off , i realized that we were missing our passports and our other travel documents . we became very worried when we couldn’t find them following a scan of the nearby area . we had lost our passports between baggage tag check-in and baggage drop off . a short distance traveled - how could this be possible ? i asked several of the air transat staff in the area for help . they alerted all staff that if they found something to let us know . they also had a few people search with me around the area . tracing our steps , we remembered that we had taken off our jackets and packed them in our luggage prior to luggage drop off . were the documents in our luggage , packed with our jackets ? air transat employees contacted the gate who worked with the ground crew at retrieving our luggage as we rushed to the gate to open them up UNKNOWNTOKEN that our passports were there . we were very close to missing our flight . we opened the luggage , and nothing was there . i decided to leave the family at the gate and go back to the check-in to see if there was any progress . with a very helpful employee that saw me in distress , we checked in all the garbage , under the check-in machines , on the conveyor belts at the check-in station . the passports and documents were gone . and we had missed our flight . at that point , i thanked the staff , realizing that our mexican holiday needed to be postponed . we got in the car on the way home children crying , and both my wife and i very stressed . we started making plans at rushing to take passport pictures , go to the passport office and pay for expedient service and hoping we can save at least part of our trip . the UNKNOWNTOKEN UNKNOWNTOKEN of anger , despair , exhaustion and UNKNOWNTOKEN were unbearable . on the way home i received a text from one of the staff . they had found one of the 4 passports . i couldn’t believe it ! i then got a call about 10 minutes later . they had found 2 more ! they had sent the airport staff to go and UNKNOWNTOKEN the length of the conveyor belt within the airport where the UNKNOWNTOKEN traveled . even though we had left the airport they didn't stop looking . we got home with UNKNOWNTOKEN UNKNOWNTOKEN . if they could only find the last one the trip may be saved . we got the call . they had found the 4th passport . they had to check every UNKNOWNTOKEN around the conveyor belts which travel for several UNKNOWNTOKEN within the airport . they actually had to have someone climb into a few UNKNOWNTOKEN areas to get into some sections . we were so grateful and was going to call our travel agent to book us on the next available flight . air transat staff said we shouldn’t worry about that . the next flight out was at UNKNOWNTOKEN that evening , and they can rebook us on that flight directly with no cost to us . this was the icing on the cake .
 i was very impressed with the way the air france staff handled everything , from my departure in barcelona to landing in mumbai . we experienced bad luck with the weather , we were going to land in mumbai before time but there was a storm and we had to UNKNOWNTOKEN to bangalore and UNKNOWNTOKEN before we could head to mumbai when the weather got better . overall the experience was so bad , but you could not get frustrated at the airline because they were so understanding and reassuring . while we had an additional 5 hours of just sitting around and waiting , they had to do extra hours of very hard work dealing with frustrated passengers ! just wanted to leave a positive review for how polite the flight attendants were , how much they smiled and looked after me !
 i booked flights for my family on this route . we had a further connection from chicago to UNKNOWNTOKEN . the woman at the desk at the gold coast was so helpful and friendly in getting us sorted and informed on how to get our bags all the way to UNKNOWNTOKEN (we had to recheck them when we landed in chicago , which we weren't told by our booking agent) . staff on the flights , particularly the long haul from auckland to chicago , were fantastic . they did everything to be of assistance to us - my wife is pregnant and we were traveling with our 6 month old too .
 gatwick to toronto . this was the best flight of my life . the staff were UNKNOWNTOKEN and the pilot kept the passenger informed about the delay (there was a two hour delay but the flight quality made up for it) . the flight attendants were so kind and helpful . there was also complementary drinks and a meal and snacks . all of which were delicious . the staff also helped passengers move to seat where they might be more comfortable after departure . because if this , i was able to spend the flight in an aisle seat where there wasn’t someone next to me , rather then in a middle seat UNKNOWNTOKEN between two strangers .
 dubai to paris . i was not given the option to reserve my seat , now i'm stuck in the middle seat with no room to UNKNOWNTOKEN . i would definitely rate this flight zero stars . never had this issue with delta or emirates .
 having flown with this airline for quite some time , it is for the first time i feel compelled to write a review which is essentially to highlight the UNKNOWNTOKEN and enthusiasm of two air india staff . UNKNOWNTOKEN at the ticketing counter and UNKNOWNTOKEN at the boarding gate , had UNKNOWNTOKEN in their eyes , UNKNOWNTOKEN in their steps and an infectious smile while attending to all UNKNOWNTOKEN of queries of passengers yet not letting the guard down in these covid UNKNOWNTOKEN times . there UNKNOWNTOKEN customers behaviour and UNKNOWNTOKEN to take that extra step for our satisfaction and making us comfortable is UNKNOWNTOKEN .
 delhi to UNKNOWNTOKEN . the load factor was quite full . departure and arrival was on time and the crew were active to ensure that passengers follow the rules and UNKNOWNTOKEN during this time . again there was no food and beverages except water served . i was able to reach my destination safe securely and air india is still happening to run flights , though their prices are higher than average . this crisis has shown a face of the airline that is otherwise not seen by the regular public .
 mumbai to delhi by air india . me and my partner had purchased tickets to go to our final destination but as there was no direct flights , we had to book the flight to our destination via delhi . the booking process was smooth especially when you consider that during the covid-19 crisis , most carriers were busy cancelling flights , however we noticed that air india flights were operating and looking at the previous record of flights we decided to go ahead with them . the tickets were on the high side but in these times having an airline actually fly instead of cancelling the flight is a game UNKNOWNTOKEN . the boarding actually started well before the scheduled time and as there were lots of passengers flying , a boeing 777 was used instead of the airbus . there was no food on this flight and for those allotted the middle seats , we had to wear the UNKNOWNTOKEN equipment provided by the airline . departure and arrival were both on time . so bravo air india for once again coming to the nations rescue not only during the UNKNOWNTOKEN UNKNOWNTOKEN UNKNOWNTOKEN but also during these difficult times . my impression of air india during this crisis has increased UNKNOWNTOKEN and UNKNOWNTOKEN .
 UNKNOWNTOKEN to UNKNOWNTOKEN . i was traveling with my elder sister who is more than 70 years old . the airline staff were really caring and helpful in the entire process of check in , boarding , deboarding , and luggage collection . they took special care to arrange equipment so that my sister can easily reach her seat . actually , she was not able to use UNKNOWNTOKEN to reach her seat .
 i had a surprisingly stellar experience despite an overall horrific travel experience . i had booked my initial travel on business class on UNKNOWNTOKEN airlines from los angeles to UNKNOWNTOKEN since it was the shortest flight in the duration of UNKNOWNTOKEN total . it was on may UNKNOWNTOKEN , 2019 . by the time i got to warsaw and waited for 6 hours that was expected , then there were delays , then UNKNOWNTOKEN they cancelled the flight at the last moment and informed us that we needed to wait for another 24 hours to fly to tbilisi . they did provide a hotel . however , i had a family waiting for me for a celebration and i needed to get to tbilisi as soon as possible . so , i arranged an UNKNOWNTOKEN fight back to paris , then to tbilisi that saved more time . my overall flight lasted 37 hours and included lots of UNKNOWNTOKEN , but i have to mention the UNKNOWNTOKEN through air france that provided light and amazing service through this ordeal . the flight to paris included this delightful female (unfortunately i didn’t get her UNKNOWNTOKEN flight attendant that made things so pleasant . from paris to UNKNOWNTOKEN , on the last exhausting leg , i encountered a flight attendant named UNKNOWNTOKEN , who made my day pleasant . i can not UNKNOWNTOKEN how he changed my horrific flight experience to quite pleasant . he was authentic , didn’t try too hard . light attendants have a difficult job of dealing with stressed public .
 krakow to amsterdam via paris . this company is improving UNKNOWNTOKEN each day . their management of delays is top of the line . i got instantly rebooked to an earlier flight in order to get on time for my connecting flight in amsterdam .
 tokyo to auckland . i traveled firstly from UNKNOWNTOKEN to auckland and the baggage UNKNOWNTOKEN seriously damaged my bag . i flow the next day and on arrival UNKNOWNTOKEN air nz . the response was immediate , and was sorted out then and there . they replaced my bag so i was able to travel 3 weeks with no UNKNOWNTOKEN . narita airport ground staff were fantastic . i am gluten UNKNOWNTOKEN and the meals were great .
 i had read some of the reviews , so was a little concerned , but loved the price . there was no charge for our luggage ! we got lunch , with a complimentary glass of wine at no extra cost . we also got a snack shortly before descending into vancouver . the entertainment was in the seatback in front of me . movies , tv shows , etc , again , no extra cost .
 flying return from auckland to london heathrow i had a pretty good experience . on my first flight , i didnt have a copy of the airline magazine , and asked the staff . they explained that something had happened and they hadn't been put on the flight . i wasn't originally best pleased . a week later , as i boarded my flight back to nz , i presented my boarding pass while getting on the plane . the steward immediately said UNKNOWNTOKEN i've heard you missed out on the UNKNOWNTOKEN UNKNOWNTOKEN magazine last flight , we've got a copy here ready for you" . they brought this to my seat a few minutes later , with another apology for not having it the first time .
 bucharest otp to moscow svo airport . i did my checkin at home and came with printed boarding pass . at otp airport they were not able to scan the barcode and had to "board me by hand" in their system . it's bucharest airport problem because in moscow i could board with the pass printed on the same printer . almost 3 hours fly . i flew with a new suchoi superjet with 3-2 economy class seat configuration (left to right) . the seats were incredibly comfortable , covered with a pleasant fabric and plenty of leg room . there was no inflight entertainment , nor wifi or usb ports , but for a short 3 hours flight that was not critical . the cabin was quiet , no disturbing noise from engines . i can not comment on food quality since i ordered a special meal (which was very very tasty - especially grechka i missed a lot) . there was a decent variety of soft drinks . no alcohol on board (not even for sale) .
 houston to frankfurt via montreal . i showed up at the houston airport without my passport and there was not time to go home to get it and return . the flight had been booked through priceline so i called them . they said i was out of luck and there was nothing they could do . then i tried calling air canada who the flight was through . the air canada lady worked hard to find an alternate route to tel aviv the same day since i had a tour starting the next morning . she was able to get an alternate route booked for me later in the day at no extra charge . i loved the plane , the food , and the personnel , not to mention that air canada was more affordable for me . they will be the first option on my list for my next flight overseas !
 flew on embraer 190 from sfo to yvr and have to say that the fa was absolutely the best i have experienced . service was top notch . had no problems with the inflight entertainment system either . if you are going to be flying executive first on em190 try and book a seat on the left side of the cabin since you will have the half of the aircraft to yourself .
 i didn't like that they changed the type of plane that i had booked , seems to be that this is normal . anyway i was impressed with the comfort of the seats , the food , the internet and the service .
 almaty to astana . consistency of ground service , food , cabin service and inflight entertainment are core values of this airline . sometimes i push myself to have connecting flights to the destinations where they have no direct flights .
 was delayed in dublin , flight cancelled to jersey in the end , but put in marvellous hotel , provided 3 course meal and prompt transport back to airport in the morning . greatful thanks to aer lingus and taxi service they provided .
 vienna to bangkok via beijing . my flight into beijing from vienna was delayed due to weather , so i missed my 8.15 connection to bangkok . i had another flight out from bangkok at 17.30 that day with a different airline , and there was no room on the next flight to bangkok 4 hours later . the international dept went out of their way taking time to find me a different air china flight direct to my ultimate destination , so i didn't have to spend more nights not sleeping in an airport . i was so relieved and grateful for their diligence . the food was good , i had the best seitan , chinese mushroom and bamboo shoot stew i have had and arrived that evening at my thai destination in fine form . just goes to show , never mind how much one has paid , a passenger is a passenger and deserves to be well-treated .
 london heathrow to algiers on an old 767 . cabin crew are simply not professional food wasn't appealing and toilets were filthy .
 my wife and i really enjoyed our stay at the barcelo maya palace resort . the flight from toronto to cancun on february 3 , 2023 was flawless . on our return date on february 17 , 2022 , we were supposed to be picked up at the resort by included shuttle as notified by the app the day before at 8 .30am . the shuttle arrived late and picked up a family but we were left stranded by the driver who informed us that we were not on the list and he had no room for us as the shuttle was full . a cab was dispatched that brought us to the airport for dollar 75 american dollars . i was given a receipt by the driver . at the air transat check in kiosk , i spoke with an air transat representative at the kiosk . she acted promptly and she personally took the time to speak with the air transat people at a nearby office and immediately was able to reimburse me for the cost of the taxi . great customer service . i have flown with air transat in the past and i will continue to do so in the future . all around , great customer service . thank you .
 april 27 2013 we took an a330 airbus from dublin to orlando direct . the food was the best i have had on an airline . all flight attendants were cheerful and courteous . the only complaint is that at dublin airport our boarding passes stated that the gate closed at 10.55 am even though our flight did not leave until 12.40 pm . i do not appreciate being given misleading information like that even if the airline is only doing it to get the slackers to show up on time . i say leave them a couple of times when they are late and they will learn to be on time and not cause the rest of us to show up at the gate only to sit for almost two more hours after already spending two hours going through security and customs ! also the seat cushions on the plane are getting too compressed to have a comfortable trip lasting 9 hours . the seat cushions should be replaced with new ones .
 athens to rome , and my third flight with aegean airlines , and they improved their service the last 2 years . for a 2 hour flight the service was equal as a part of an intercontinental flight . no ife - not sure if need in a short flight with a regional carrier , but in any case not many airlines in europe offer this value for money . compliments .
 toronto to london . this review is only for check-in desk staff . my kid and parents were travelling , and their seats were not together . the staff were humble and helpful and went above and beyond to get their seats together . i really appreciate her efforts as my kid was just 21 months old . i'm really thankful to that lady .
 after a nightmare experience with united (who rebooked us with their star alliance partner aegean) including several delays , and cancellations , we arrived in athens to no luggage , which was united's responsibility , not aegean's . we dealt with united for four days trying to get our luggage from newark to athens . eventually they told us to taxi back to the airport and promised our luggage was there , a very kind supervisor came out and talked to us to explain the luggage was not , in fact , there . (we did not even ask for a supervisor .) he was very understanding and patient and asked us to trust him . at this point our time in athens was over and we left the airport to board our cruise ship , thinking there was no way we'd ever get our luggage in the middle of the ocean . the next night there it was in our cabin when we opened the door ! we couldn't believe it . the supervisor had gotten our luggage from newark to athens , then onto santorini island , where our princess cruise ship then transported it from the island and onto the ship and then to our room - all within a day . in all we went five days without luggage , but once aegean was involved we had it within about a day , in a much more difficult route than it would have been for united to simply put it on the plane to athens . everyone was so compassionate and kind . but it didn't end there . upon arriving home , i began the impossible task of dealing with united to receive compensation - they had told us to keep all receipts for the five days without luggage and we had . we spent hours on hold , hours on the phone , getting nowhere . finally , based on the file reference number (that i'd given them over and over and over) someone finally clued in and explained the international agreement that wherever you end up is who is responsible for the luggage . wait , so we get to deal with aegean again ? wonderful ! i called and a kind man explained exactly what to do and gave me an email . in less than a day i got a response telling me exactly what to do to make a very easy process go smoothly . i've spent three weeks with united and got nowhere , while being treated rudely . in the last few days everything has been submitted to aegean in a easy process with a kind person on the other end helping . we wouldn't have realized how amazing aegean is had we not had such a bad experience through their sister airline , that only aegean resolved , for them . aegean went above and beyond , with every person we dealt with , they will be the first we use if at all possible .
 vancouver to osaka . we found this flight comfortable and the crew provided good service . it seems that many people are aggravated by the lack of screens on the back of seats , to provide distraction in flight . we never pay attention to those anyhow , except to track the plane's location . the food was good . the seats were good because recline was quite limited and so the people in front of us did not push back into our space . we got two meals which were palatable . seating is 2xx2 so we did not have to climb over anyone to get to the aisle . i'd be happy to travel on this aircraft with this airline again .
 my wife and i flew aeromexico for the first time this past june . we didn't know what to expect but were extremely pleased . the planes we flew to and from cancun were new and clean . screens at every seat . great service from staff . kicker is that i somehow managed to lose my iphone on the way back home . i thought it must have been at the cancun airport so i called them a few times to check the lost and found . nothing . then about three days after my flight i got a call from aeromexico that they had discovered my phone on the plane . i hadn't even informed them that it was missing because i checked my seat area and was fairly sure that it wasn't there . honestly i don't even know how they managed to figure out whose phone it was . they may have had to call multiple people in our area of the plane . anyway i went back to the airport and remarkably , they had my phone . i was relieved and extremely impressed . needless to say i would highly recommend this airline to anyone flying to/from mexico . and they are linked to delta so i believe your points will accrue as skymiles .
 i recently travelled from calgary by air canada . to salt lake city through houston texas . the flight attendants could not have been more helpful and pleasant . my connection at houston was tight . unknown to me they arranged for me to move to the front of the plane so i could be one the first to get off . i was in a wheelchair . the airport worker in houston dropped the ball and did not take me to my next gate as arranged . as a result i missed my connection and had to wait until the next day to get to salt lake city . air canada had i felt gone out of their way for me .
 i had an excellent experience with aeromexico . they took care of my dietary concerns and i was aware of the baggage policy when traveling to and from south america . agents met me with instructions concerning my bags in both directions .
 what a wonderful friendly airline . flew with them hholguin to havana and back . both flights only minor delays was served juice and a cake on this short internal flight safety demonstration was done .
 disgraceful airline and an absolute shame to canadian standards . i had a simple 1.5 hour direct journey from boston to toronto . this UNKNOWNTOKEN into a nightmare that lasted about 12 hours . two of my flights from boston to toronto in the morning were cancelled , thus missed my connection at noon with another airline ! rebooked flight was from boston to montreal to toronto of which both flights were delayed by over 1.5 hours . if you are looking for punctual and good service , look elsewhere please !
 UNKNOWNTOKEN one way . a very bad experience . check in was a mess ticket incredibly expensive for what they offer . excess baggage 10 euro per kilo . on board you have to pay for everything and very expensive . plane was old and not very clean . legroom was a nightmare and seats uncomfortable . and the most UNKNOWNTOKEN crew very rude and not smiling .
 prague to toronto . violin cruise line booked my sister and me on air canada from prague to toronto . little did i know that the flight was on air canada rouge that doesn't have UNKNOWNTOKEN UNKNOWNTOKEN and expects one to know that one must fly with their own ipad and headphones plus download the air canada app prior to takeoff . they mention UNKNOWNTOKEN the app but i did not realise it is mandatory to do so to be able to watch movies on one's cell phone or ipad until one is in the air and it is too late ! (unless you wish to rent their ipad) . it was nearly 9 hours in a seat that did not recline with discount beverages and lousy meals .
 london gatwick to toronto with air canada rouge during august 2016 . this was a very poor flight . there many UNKNOWNTOKEN . first , there was no inflight entertainment at all . we were told that there was inflight wifi but this did not work . very disappointing on such a long flight . the food was also poor and the announcements on the UNKNOWNTOKEN system were frequently UNKNOWNTOKEN . but by far , the worst aspect of the flight was the very limited legroom available . i am over 6' tall , and i UNKNOWNTOKEN to find a comfortable position throughout this flight . on a long 8 hour flight i would have expected more room . i have flown many times with other carriers and have had adequate leg room on longer flights . i have also sometimes flown on short european low cost airline carriers with more legroom than this , and they are much cheaper carriers . what is surprising is that we flew a much shorter connecting flight (just over 4 hours) from toronto to victoria bc with air canada and had all the facilities that i described above . so why did air canada rouge not provide a better service for the much longer leg of the journey ? i don't like to sound so negative and would not give negative feedback easily but this carrier were very poor value for money .
 lost luggage is a major problem for air canada as i learned the hard way . lost UNKNOWNTOKEN bags , huge line at copenhagen airport of other air canada customers who similarly had lost luggage on multiple ac flights . what is most disconcerting is the number of large carts of lost luggage labeled with dates going back up to a week in full public access that had not even been touched by ac staff which makes me highly doubt the ac claim that they are doing everything they can to UNKNOWNTOKEN lost luggage with travelers . if you are planning to travel with air canada , my advice is not to check bags right now .
 sunday 21st june , shanghai to mexico city premier class . old aircraft with no inflight entertainment this situation bother me so much . there was also a complete lack of interest shown by the cabin crew in their jobs . very disappointing . the flying experience was not be very good on premier class after i bought an upgrade from economy class .
 super convenient 3 pm departure from delhi . only direct flight from delhi to madrid . excellent legroom in economy class - more than any other long-haul airline i have been on . adequate film choices in english . decent meal , UNKNOWNTOKEN snack - more UNKNOWNTOKEN than ana which i flew to tokyo from delhi last month . absolutely nothing wrong in traveling this airline . asked for a gin and tonic , got two without asking . just don't understand why people UNKNOWNTOKEN this airline so much . it's my preferred choice in economy when possible .
 flew air france from london heathrow to cape town via paris . as an UNKNOWNTOKEN crew member of the UNKNOWNTOKEN vintage , i am UNKNOWNTOKEN of the service onboard which ever airline i travel with . i was most impressed with most aspects of the flight - my first with this airline . the senior cabin crew manager was charming and helpful in the extreme , moving me to a vacant seat that had much more legroom , and also offered me his personal UNKNOWNTOKEN that UNKNOWNTOKEN me to charge my ipad . the seat was just ok , however , as other reviewers have mentioned . the people who introduced this new seat should get UNKNOWNTOKEN UNKNOWNTOKEN , the british vacuum UNKNOWNTOKEN , to have a look as it , as it is not comfortable . plenty of pillows did help though . i am returning in business class , so will report on that in a couple of weeks time . UNKNOWNTOKEN , the transit at cdg airport was seamless , and my suitcase was waiting for me on arrival . well done air france .
 i took a flight from dublin to toronto with air transat over the summer . this is my fourth year in a row with the company and they never fail to disappoint . staff are friendly and the aircraft spotless . definitely value for money .
