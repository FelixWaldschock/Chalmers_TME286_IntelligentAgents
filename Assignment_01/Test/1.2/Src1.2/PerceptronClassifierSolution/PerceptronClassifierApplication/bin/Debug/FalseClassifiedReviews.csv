 UNKNOWNTOKEN seats . i fly constantly , maybe 50 flights a year . these are the worst seats i've ever UNKNOWNTOKEN in . i weigh about UNKNOWNTOKEN and am 5' UNKNOWNTOKEN . i have UNKNOWNTOKEN legs for my UNKNOWNTOKEN . still i can point my knees forward as they press into the seat in front of me . every move the person makes in front of me , i feel . now . i flew on points . so even with my air canada status they shoved me to the back of the plane (with my UNKNOWNTOKEN . they should be ashamed . my wife actually felt claustrophobic . air canada . anything for a UNKNOWNTOKEN .
 london heathrow to cork . what a disappointment ! after travelling half way around the world , being UNKNOWNTOKEN to some super airport and inflight service , to finish our journey on our own countries carrier aer lingus , should have been great , how wrong we were . staff at the check in desk UNKNOWNTOKEN gum and dressed scruffy set the tone , very poor . called to check in and then made stand for 40 minutes just past the check in desk ? why check in passengers and make them stand in a small area , when the plane hasn't disembarked it's previous passengers ? this shows a total lack of regard for the elderly , people not in full health and people completing long journeys . after 40 minutes of standing we went back past the check in area to the seats so the kids could sit comfortably and complained to aer lingus staff , not that they seemed to care as they were to interested in chatting amongst themselves . and why does it take 6 staff to check in a small plane ? unfortunately things on the plane weren't much better , poorly dressed staff looking tired and rough , we couldn't understand the lady on the UNKNOWNTOKEN reading the safety statement , neither could the girl UNKNOWNTOKEN this as they were in and out of UNKNOWNTOKEN , lack of professional refreshment service provided as the first thing they were asked for off the menu seemed to UNKNOWNTOKEN the stewardess and she UNKNOWNTOKEN for a while and returned with a no we don't have that . it was only a sandwich that was requested by another passenger . obviously there are good staff with aer lingus also , but this is spoilt by a poor few and bad practices . i would recommend management in aer lingus should get on a singapore airlines flight to see how it should be done , very well dressed staff throughout a long flight , very attentive and polite to any need or request , each one of them asked the name of our kids and used it when talking to them (aer lingus staff didn't bother to ask , the UNKNOWNTOKEN gum was obviously in the way) , very well organised at check in time even though dealing with a great deal more passengers and it didn't take six of them to do it either ! come on aer lingus staff you can do much better than this , and it wouldn't take much , just a better regard for your customers and some manners .
 disgraceful airline and an absolute shame to canadian standards . i had a simple 1.5 hour direct journey from boston to toronto . this UNKNOWNTOKEN into a nightmare that lasted about 12 hours . two of my flights from boston to toronto in the morning were cancelled , thus missed my connection at noon with another airline ! rebooked flight was from boston to montreal to toronto of which both flights were delayed by over 1.5 hours . if you are looking for punctual and good service , look elsewhere please !
 UNKNOWNTOKEN one way . a very bad experience . check in was a mess ticket incredibly expensive for what they offer . excess baggage 10 euro per kilo . on board you have to pay for everything and very expensive . plane was old and not very clean . legroom was a nightmare and seats uncomfortable . and the most UNKNOWNTOKEN crew very rude and not smiling .
 prague to toronto . violin cruise line booked my sister and me on air canada from prague to toronto . little did i know that the flight was on air canada rouge that doesn't have UNKNOWNTOKEN UNKNOWNTOKEN and expects one to know that one must fly with their own ipad and headphones plus download the air canada app prior to takeoff . they mention UNKNOWNTOKEN the app but i did not realise it is mandatory to do so to be able to watch movies on one's cell phone or ipad until one is in the air and it is too late ! (unless you wish to rent their ipad) . it was nearly 9 hours in a seat that did not recline with discount beverages and lousy meals .
 the flight duration was 9 hrs & 15 min . there were only two food/drink services throughout the entire flight . they did not even offer water . you had to call the flight attendants to get water and you could not even buy drinks on the flight . the service on air canada is consistently terrible . if they had some meaningful competition , things would have been completely different , in my opinion . to be fair , the in-flight entertainment was good .
 without question this is the worst long haul flight i have ever taken . i couldn’t believe that for 11 hours we were UNKNOWNTOKEN to the limited legroom of a 737 . was the 737 designed for long haul ? the first leg of the overnight flight , from vancouver to halifax , didn’t serve a meal , but put out the lights and expected us to sleep . during the night we were hungry and UNKNOWNTOKEN , and had to go to the galley and ask for refreshments . thank goodness we managed to buy a decent breakfast at halifax airport ! then back onto another 737 for the second leg of the flight . the meal offered was small and fairly UNKNOWNTOKEN (i think the worst i have ever experienced on long UNKNOWNTOKEN , and again the need to visit the galley to stay hydrated . the overhead lockers were absolutely jam packed by the time we got seated , and i ended up putting my UNKNOWNTOKEN under the seat , eating into my already limited legroom . it’s almost impossible to compare air canada with other carriers which i use for long haul e.g. ba , thai , UNKNOWNTOKEN , cathay , emirates , where the passenger is kept fed and hydrated by attentive staff . when i arrived at heathrow i took two flights to reach home in northern UNKNOWNTOKEN with ba and UNKNOWNTOKEN . each flight was less than an hour and had i more room and comfort than crossing the atlantic !
 UNKNOWNTOKEN . i could not check-in online so called up the airlines to find my flight was re-scheduled . my connecting flight had been rescheduled so that my transit took 24 hrs and they wouldn't provide any sort of accommodation . moscow airport contains narrow UNKNOWNTOKEN with duty free shops food must be paid with russian money . there was free internet but only in a few places with low wifi UNKNOWNTOKEN . plane food was bland and mediocre . average service .
 bangkok to montreal via beijing . you get what you pay for . this was my first time and last time flying air china . i'm UNKNOWNTOKEN how they could pass star alliance basic standards . first , my flight was cancelled and i had to fly one day later . their ticket office offered me a refund or change the booking to the next day . having no choice to come back home , i had to take the flight the day after . regarding the check-in , i had issues on both legs . from bangkok , the check-in is done by thai airways staff but they were useless . i arrived 2 hours before at the airport and almost missed my flight because they could not fix the issue . i was traveling with my wife , an infant and a child . i had requested a baby bassinet which was only done on one leg . they had the great idea to put my wife and the infant on the first row and me and my child on a different row at the back of the plane . they couldn't give us seats all together so me and my wife could take care of our baby together . i even talked to the station manager in beijing on the phone but she could not care less . on the way back , it was even more ridiculous . the check-in staff was very rude . the flight was full so they upgraded my wife to premium economy but me , my infant and child in economy . despite asking them to downgrade my wife so we could all seat together , they refused . they said they were unable to downgrade my wife nor upgrade the rest of my family so we could all seat together . what kind of airlines would separate a family on long-haul ? this happened on both legs , so i assume this happened often . during the flight , the entertainment system was mostly for chinese as there were very few english movies . as for the food , i would advice anyone to bring some snacks on board . there were only selection of chinese food which was simply disgusting . it was so bad that i couldn't tell what kind of meat it was . my wife and i took different dishes to spread the risk , and all of them were very bad . last but not least , when we came back home , we had one luggage missing . i took them 4 days to bring it back and my suitcase is really damaged so i can't use it anymore . my only positive point , which i was very surprised considering their ground staff , is that the crew were very nice and friendly .
 air canada rouge has got to be the worst airline that we have flown . we flew from vancouver to honolulu on a b767 aircraft . it was a very old airplane and a very dirty one too . such neglect is simply unacceptable in the 21st UNKNOWNTOKEN . a very bad image for the mother company indeed . i understand that it is a cheaper airline but still they have to do something about cleanliness . nevertheless , i have to say that cabin crew was very polite and professional .
 london gatwick to toronto with air canada rouge during august 2016 . this was a very poor flight . there many UNKNOWNTOKEN . first , there was no inflight entertainment at all . we were told that there was inflight wifi but this did not work . very disappointing on such a long flight . the food was also poor and the announcements on the UNKNOWNTOKEN system were frequently UNKNOWNTOKEN . but by far , the worst aspect of the flight was the very limited legroom available . i am over 6' tall , and i UNKNOWNTOKEN to find a comfortable position throughout this flight . on a long 8 hour flight i would have expected more room . i have flown many times with other carriers and have had adequate leg room on longer flights . i have also sometimes flown on short european low cost airline carriers with more legroom than this , and they are much cheaper carriers . what is surprising is that we flew a much shorter connecting flight (just over 4 hours) from toronto to victoria bc with air canada and had all the facilities that i described above . so why did air canada rouge not provide a better service for the much longer leg of the journey ? i don't like to sound so negative and would not give negative feedback easily but this carrier were very poor value for money .
 very frustrating experience with air canada . overbooked , assigned seats separately and not able to change that to have seats together . crew was not helpful and very irritated , makes you feel sorry that you asked anything . after continuous delays , when we finally started disembarkation the crew was very eager to leave the plane and rushed us in a rude manner .
 plane was tired but clean , staff were dreadful . saw the staff with a meal at the beginning of the night flight and then again at breakfast time before landing . no drinks even water offered through the night . family with two year old UNKNOWNTOKEN behind me , never witnessed any help or a reassuring word offered to them . the staff didn’t really have a pleasant word for anyone . went to the toilet in the night and it was awful , smelt and the seat was very dirty , needed checking a little more often . breakfast was a UNKNOWNTOKEN paper bag with a croissant and plain yoghurt , the croissant was so cold it really was inedible , so as you might have UNKNOWNTOKEN we won’t be flying air canada again
 i flew aer lingus from san francisco to venice via dublin return . i have flown most of the major airlines and i never experienced such horrible treatment , especially on transatlantic flights . when i got in my seat for the venice to dublin flight there was a paper cup left in the pocket from the previous traveler . on the flight from dublin to sfo , a UNKNOWNTOKEN hour flight , i was given a meal in the first hour of the flight and what might be considered a sandwich the last hour . in between the cabin crew turned into concession sales people UNKNOWNTOKEN the most atrocious snacks . after the initial beverage service the cabin crew did not come around once to offer water . if you wanted water you had to go to the UNKNOWNTOKEN UNKNOWNTOKEN and ask for it . then , i received a feedback survey from aer lingus and the survey didn't come up . it read could not find the UNKNOWNTOKEN . nice to know that they really don't want to know how their service is , with the way they run their airline . i wouldn't want to know either , unless i was really interested in improving .
 on 17 jul 22 , my family and i traveled under air canada UNKNOWNTOKEN booking # UNKNOWNTOKEN to catch a flight (flight # UNKNOWNTOKEN from toronto UNKNOWNTOKEN to pittsburgh international airport UNKNOWNTOKEN leaving UNKNOWNTOKEN UNKNOWNTOKEN at UNKNOWNTOKEN hrs . we had arrived earlier in the day around 1630 to UNKNOWNTOKEN on ac flight UNKNOWNTOKEN from athens , greece an UNKNOWNTOKEN UNKNOWNTOKEN flight . we had about a UNKNOWNTOKEN layover between flights . around UNKNOWNTOKEN hrs , just before our scheduled boarding time , an ac rep , announced over the pa system there could be a delay of about a 1/2 hour - hour , as a UNKNOWNTOKEN had not arrived for our flight . surprisingly , around UNKNOWNTOKEN hrs , the ac rep announced we all would board the plane for pit . all pit passengers boarded the flight for pit , after about 15 - 20 mins we were informed by the pilot that the UNKNOWNTOKEN hadn't arrived , the flight was canceled , and we had to deplane & go back in the terminal and see ac personnel on the 3rd floor for assistance in rebooking our flight . my UNKNOWNTOKEN of the UNKNOWNTOKEN passengers deplaned & went inside , where an ac rep let us know we would have to go through customs UNKNOWNTOKEN ! ) , and try to get rebooked on another pit flight . this would be the last information an UNKNOWNTOKEN ac rep gave us at UNKNOWNTOKEN UNKNOWNTOKEN , and things became very disorganized . we made it through customs and went to retrieve our bags no ac rep was there to give UNKNOWNTOKEN UNKNOWNTOKEN over an hour ! ) . the ac area was a UNKNOWNTOKEN complete with crying children & UNKNOWNTOKEN adults who didn't know what to do . when we finally got my UNKNOWNTOKEN luggage it was badly damaged UNKNOWNTOKEN wheel UNKNOWNTOKEN case UNKNOWNTOKEN the luggage was only a few yrs old , and cost around dollar 100 . we discussed renting a car UNKNOWNTOKEN to UNKNOWNTOKEN and driving home that night , as my wife and i had work the next day , and my daughter had a law school UNKNOWNTOKEN class . we were exhausted & just needed to get home . while my wife & daughter , who were exhausted & frustrated waited for our baggage , i went to the 3rd floor & tried to find an UNKNOWNTOKEN ac rep , but to no avail , all ac personnel appeared to be gone for the day . an airport employee directed me to a bank of phones to contact ac for rebooking & to get a voucher for a hotel if we had to stay overnight . i called from the bank of phone got disconnected ! however , a fellow passenger was able to get in touch with an ac UNKNOWNTOKEN , i UNKNOWNTOKEN , who advised he could book my family on a ac flight from UNKNOWNTOKEN to pit the next afternoon around UNKNOWNTOKEN hrs . he also advised he couldn't help with UNKNOWNTOKEN a hotel , but if we could manage to get a hotel room , we could submit the expenses to ac for UNKNOWNTOKEN reimbursement . i asked UNKNOWNTOKEN about getting reimbursed by ac for renting a car and driving home UNKNOWNTOKEN rental to UNKNOWNTOKEN he informed ac would definitely reimburse us for this expense , as well as fuel costs for the vehicle , if we submitted receipts to the ac website . based upon the UNKNOWNTOKEN UNKNOWNTOKEN from an ac rep that we would be reimbursed for renting a vehicle (& fuel for UNKNOWNTOKEN we made the decision to rent a car , which took over an hour and cost dollar 300 we also incurred fuel and UNKNOWNTOKEN charges . arrived home about UNKNOWNTOKEN hrs , totally stressed out and sick to our UNKNOWNTOKEN . filed a claim with ac & after now about 45 days , all we have received is an UNKNOWNTOKEN reply email ac UNKNOWNTOKEN our claim . no reimbursement , no phone call from ac with an update , & certainly no apology from ac ! all we ask is that someone from ac have the decency to help resolve this UNKNOWNTOKEN claim .
 sunday 21st june , shanghai to mexico city premier class . old aircraft with no inflight entertainment this situation bother me so much . there was also a complete lack of interest shown by the cabin crew in their jobs . very disappointing . the flying experience was not be very good on premier class after i bought an upgrade from economy class .
 super convenient 3 pm departure from delhi . only direct flight from delhi to madrid . excellent legroom in economy class - more than any other long-haul airline i have been on . adequate film choices in english . decent meal , UNKNOWNTOKEN snack - more UNKNOWNTOKEN than ana which i flew to tokyo from delhi last month . absolutely nothing wrong in traveling this airline . asked for a gin and tonic , got two without asking . just don't understand why people UNKNOWNTOKEN this airline so much . it's my preferred choice in economy when possible .
