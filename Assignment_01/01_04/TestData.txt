The quarter sovereign is a British gold bullion and collectors' coin, issued by the Royal Mint since 2009. The smallest in the sovereign range, it has a face value of 25 pence.

In 1853, the Royal Mint produced two patterns for a quarter sovereign for circulation, with one denominated as five shillings.[a] These coins never went into production, due to concerns about their small size and the likely wear in circulation. Gold passed from circulation in the aftermath of the First World War.
