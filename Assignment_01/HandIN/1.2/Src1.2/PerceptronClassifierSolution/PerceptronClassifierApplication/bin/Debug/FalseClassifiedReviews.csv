 puerto vallarta to costa rica via mexico city . i am not sure if it truly worth to write this aeromexico review keeping in mind that the average rating is already at 2 stars and management apparently don't care if passengers are happy for as long as bonus UNKNOWNTOKEN are great ! i truly hope that the shape of the inside of the cabin is no indication of aircraft maintenance , because inside was horrible ! broken and dirty seats and UNKNOWNTOKEN , the service provided was anything but great , one could say that the crew did not like to take early flights . the food was of the lowest possible quality standard . i wish there would be more competition out there .
 london heathrow to cork . what a disappointment ! after travelling half way around the world , being UNKNOWNTOKEN to some super airport and inflight service , to finish our journey on our own countries carrier aer lingus , should have been great , how wrong we were . staff at the check in desk UNKNOWNTOKEN gum and dressed scruffy set the tone , very poor . called to check in and then made stand for 40 minutes just past the check in desk ? why check in passengers and make them stand in a small area , when the plane hasn't disembarked it's previous passengers ? this shows a total lack of regard for the elderly , people not in full health and people completing long journeys . after 40 minutes of standing we went back past the check in area to the seats so the kids could sit comfortably and complained to aer lingus staff , not that they seemed to care as they were to interested in chatting amongst themselves . and why does it take 6 staff to check in a small plane ? unfortunately things on the plane weren't much better , poorly dressed staff looking tired and rough , we couldn't understand the lady on the UNKNOWNTOKEN reading the safety statement , neither could the girl UNKNOWNTOKEN this as they were in and out of UNKNOWNTOKEN , lack of professional refreshment service provided as the first thing they were asked for off the menu seemed to UNKNOWNTOKEN the stewardess and she UNKNOWNTOKEN for a while and returned with a no we don't have that . it was only a sandwich that was requested by another passenger . obviously there are good staff with aer lingus also , but this is spoilt by a poor few and bad practices . i would recommend management in aer lingus should get on a singapore airlines flight to see how it should be done , very well dressed staff throughout a long flight , very attentive and polite to any need or request , each one of them asked the name of our kids and used it when talking to them (aer lingus staff didn't bother to ask , the UNKNOWNTOKEN gum was obviously in the way) , very well organised at check in time even though dealing with a great deal more passengers and it didn't take six of them to do it either ! come on aer lingus staff you can do much better than this , and it wouldn't take much , just a better regard for your customers and some manners .
 prague to toronto . violin cruise line booked my sister and me on air canada from prague to toronto . little did i know that the flight was on air canada rouge that doesn't have UNKNOWNTOKEN UNKNOWNTOKEN and expects one to know that one must fly with their own ipad and headphones plus download the air canada app prior to takeoff . they mention UNKNOWNTOKEN the app but i did not realise it is mandatory to do so to be able to watch movies on one's cell phone or ipad until one is in the air and it is too late ! (unless you wish to rent their ipad) . it was nearly 9 hours in a seat that did not recline with discount beverages and lousy meals .
 london gatwick to toronto with air canada rouge during august 2016 . this was a very poor flight . there many UNKNOWNTOKEN . first , there was no inflight entertainment at all . we were told that there was inflight wifi but this did not work . very disappointing on such a long flight . the food was also poor and the announcements on the UNKNOWNTOKEN system were frequently UNKNOWNTOKEN . but by far , the worst aspect of the flight was the very limited legroom available . i am over 6' tall , and i UNKNOWNTOKEN to find a comfortable position throughout this flight . on a long 8 hour flight i would have expected more room . i have flown many times with other carriers and have had adequate leg room on longer flights . i have also sometimes flown on short european low cost airline carriers with more legroom than this , and they are much cheaper carriers . what is surprising is that we flew a much shorter connecting flight (just over 4 hours) from toronto to victoria bc with air canada and had all the facilities that i described above . so why did air canada rouge not provide a better service for the much longer leg of the journey ? i don't like to sound so negative and would not give negative feedback easily but this carrier were very poor value for money .
 plane was tired but clean , staff were dreadful . saw the staff with a meal at the beginning of the night flight and then again at breakfast time before landing . no drinks even water offered through the night . family with two year old UNKNOWNTOKEN behind me , never witnessed any help or a reassuring word offered to them . the staff didn’t really have a pleasant word for anyone . went to the toilet in the night and it was awful , smelt and the seat was very dirty , needed checking a little more often . breakfast was a UNKNOWNTOKEN paper bag with a croissant and plain yoghurt , the croissant was so cold it really was inedible , so as you might have UNKNOWNTOKEN we won’t be flying air canada again
 on 17 jul 22 , my family and i traveled under air canada UNKNOWNTOKEN booking # UNKNOWNTOKEN to catch a flight (flight # UNKNOWNTOKEN from toronto UNKNOWNTOKEN to pittsburgh international airport UNKNOWNTOKEN leaving UNKNOWNTOKEN UNKNOWNTOKEN at UNKNOWNTOKEN hrs . we had arrived earlier in the day around 1630 to UNKNOWNTOKEN on ac flight UNKNOWNTOKEN from athens , greece an UNKNOWNTOKEN UNKNOWNTOKEN flight . we had about a UNKNOWNTOKEN layover between flights . around UNKNOWNTOKEN hrs , just before our scheduled boarding time , an ac rep , announced over the pa system there could be a delay of about a 1/2 hour - hour , as a UNKNOWNTOKEN had not arrived for our flight . surprisingly , around UNKNOWNTOKEN hrs , the ac rep announced we all would board the plane for pit . all pit passengers boarded the flight for pit , after about 15 - 20 mins we were informed by the pilot that the UNKNOWNTOKEN hadn't arrived , the flight was canceled , and we had to deplane & go back in the terminal and see ac personnel on the 3rd floor for assistance in rebooking our flight . my UNKNOWNTOKEN of the UNKNOWNTOKEN passengers deplaned & went inside , where an ac rep let us know we would have to go through customs UNKNOWNTOKEN ! ) , and try to get rebooked on another pit flight . this would be the last information an UNKNOWNTOKEN ac rep gave us at UNKNOWNTOKEN UNKNOWNTOKEN , and things became very disorganized . we made it through customs and went to retrieve our bags no ac rep was there to give UNKNOWNTOKEN UNKNOWNTOKEN over an hour ! ) . the ac area was a UNKNOWNTOKEN complete with crying children & UNKNOWNTOKEN adults who didn't know what to do . when we finally got my UNKNOWNTOKEN luggage it was badly damaged UNKNOWNTOKEN wheel UNKNOWNTOKEN case UNKNOWNTOKEN the luggage was only a few yrs old , and cost around dollar 100 . we discussed renting a car UNKNOWNTOKEN to UNKNOWNTOKEN and driving home that night , as my wife and i had work the next day , and my daughter had a law school UNKNOWNTOKEN class . we were exhausted & just needed to get home . while my wife & daughter , who were exhausted & frustrated waited for our baggage , i went to the 3rd floor & tried to find an UNKNOWNTOKEN ac rep , but to no avail , all ac personnel appeared to be gone for the day . an airport employee directed me to a bank of phones to contact ac for rebooking & to get a voucher for a hotel if we had to stay overnight . i called from the bank of phone got disconnected ! however , a fellow passenger was able to get in touch with an ac UNKNOWNTOKEN , i UNKNOWNTOKEN , who advised he could book my family on a ac flight from UNKNOWNTOKEN to pit the next afternoon around UNKNOWNTOKEN hrs . he also advised he couldn't help with UNKNOWNTOKEN a hotel , but if we could manage to get a hotel room , we could submit the expenses to ac for UNKNOWNTOKEN reimbursement . i asked UNKNOWNTOKEN about getting reimbursed by ac for renting a car and driving home UNKNOWNTOKEN rental to UNKNOWNTOKEN he informed ac would definitely reimburse us for this expense , as well as fuel costs for the vehicle , if we submitted receipts to the ac website . based upon the UNKNOWNTOKEN UNKNOWNTOKEN from an ac rep that we would be reimbursed for renting a vehicle (& fuel for UNKNOWNTOKEN we made the decision to rent a car , which took over an hour and cost dollar 300 we also incurred fuel and UNKNOWNTOKEN charges . arrived home about UNKNOWNTOKEN hrs , totally stressed out and sick to our UNKNOWNTOKEN . filed a claim with ac & after now about 45 days , all we have received is an UNKNOWNTOKEN reply email ac UNKNOWNTOKEN our claim . no reimbursement , no phone call from ac with an update , & certainly no apology from ac ! all we ask is that someone from ac have the decency to help resolve this UNKNOWNTOKEN claim .
 travelling from athens to santorini in august 2014 . flight was delayed . not enough seats in airport lounge . no drinks provided . only given a cookie . travellers allowed to take extra hand luggage onto flight so there was not enough room for people who only had the one designated bag . we then had our return flight - we called the airline and asked if possible could we get on an earlier flight back to athens if there were UNKNOWNTOKEN available . we were told seats were available most of the earlier flights however it would cost us euro 112 per person to catch the earlier flight . offered us a 20 % discount on a full new fare . online price was only euro UNKNOWNTOKEN to UNKNOWNTOKEN . we had initially purchased the two seats for euro 300 . this spoilt our european vacation . we could understand a small penalty to changed however to charge a complete new ticket when there were empty seats available and there are numerous flights back and forth from santorini to athens .
 sunday 21st june , shanghai to mexico city premier class . old aircraft with no inflight entertainment this situation bother me so much . there was also a complete lack of interest shown by the cabin crew in their jobs . very disappointing . the flying experience was not be very good on premier class after i bought an upgrade from economy class .
 super convenient 3 pm departure from delhi . only direct flight from delhi to madrid . excellent legroom in economy class - more than any other long-haul airline i have been on . adequate film choices in english . decent meal , UNKNOWNTOKEN snack - more UNKNOWNTOKEN than ana which i flew to tokyo from delhi last month . absolutely nothing wrong in traveling this airline . asked for a gin and tonic , got two without asking . just don't understand why people UNKNOWNTOKEN this airline so much . it's my preferred choice in economy when possible .
 i took a flight from dublin to toronto with air transat over the summer . this is my fourth year in a row with the company and they never fail to disappoint . staff are friendly and the aircraft spotless . definitely value for money .
 travelled auckland to port vila this last weekend . for such a short hop to UNKNOWNTOKEN all aspects of the flight were excellent . as this trip was for a long weekend travelled with hand luggage only . crew on both sectors warm and welcoming not to mention UNKNOWNTOKEN .
