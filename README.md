# **Intelligent Agents – TME 286 (Chalmers University)**  

I took this course to dive into the world of **intelligent agents**—basically, software that can understand, interact, and make decisions. It covered everything from **text processing and chatbots** to **speech recognition and AI ethics**. The focus was on both theory and hands-on coding, with a lot of work in **C# .NET** and some Python.  

## **Key Takeaways**  
- Learned how to process and analyze text for AI applications  
- Built and compared different **text classification models**  
- Developed **chatbots** and **task-oriented agents**, focusing on **dialogue management**  
- Explored **statistical language models** and how they power AI systems  
- Worked with **speech synthesis & recognition** (briefly but super interesting)  
- Discussed the differences between **black-box AI** and **interpretable models**  
- Looked at **real-world AI applications** in areas like healthcare, finance, and automation  
- Dug into **ethical considerations** of AI, which turned out to be a pretty important discussion  

Overall, it was a great mix of **AI theory, coding, and real-world applications**. If you’re into **human-machine interaction, NLP, or AI-driven automation**, this course gives a solid foundation!
