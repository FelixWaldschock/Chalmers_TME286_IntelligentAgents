I want you to sort these capital cities by the population number of its country [Berlin, Rome, Paris, London]. To do so follow the steps below:
1. Find the country to each Capital, this should lead to four countries.
2. Find the population of each country.
3. List the Capitals according to the populations of their countries. Do this in a descending order, which means the capital of the country with the highest population comes first. 
Sure! Here is the list of capital cities sorted according to the populations of their countries in descending order:
---

Capital	Country	Population (Millions)
Berlin	Germany	83
London	United Kingdom	68
Paris	France	65
Rome	Italy	60
I hope this helps!
