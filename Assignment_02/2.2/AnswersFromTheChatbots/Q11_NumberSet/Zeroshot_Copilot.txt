Certainly! Let's explore the sum of the odd numbers in the given set: 10, 15, 12, 13, 21, 17.
- First, let's identify the odd numbers in the set:
    - 15, 13, 21, and 17 are odd numbers.
- Now, let's calculate their sum:
    - 15 + 13 + 21 + 17 = 66.
- Is the sum of these odd numbers an odd number itself? Let's find out:
    - The sum, 66, is indeed an even number.
Wait a minute! The sum of odd numbers should be odd, right? But here, it's even. Let's unravel this mystery.
The key lies in a fascinating pattern: the sum of any set of consecutive odd numbers starting with 1 is always equal to the square of the number of digits that were added together . Let's apply this concept:
- We have 4 odd numbers in our set: 15, 13, 21, and 17.
- The square of 4 is 16.
- Voilà! The sum of these odd numbers, 66, is indeed 16 squared.
In summary, the sum of the odd numbers in your set follows this intriguing pattern. 🧐
If you ever encounter more consecutive odd numbers, you can use this formula to find their sum:
- Choose the ending point (last consecutive number in your set).
- Add 1 to the ending point.
- Divide the result by 2.
- Square the quotient.
And there you have it—the sum of consecutive odd numbers! 🌟
