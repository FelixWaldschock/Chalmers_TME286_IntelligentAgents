The even numbers in this set add up to an odd number: 10,15,12,13,21,17


It is not possible for the even numbers in a set to add up to an odd number. This is because:

Even numbers: Any integer divisible by 2 is considered an even number. Adding two even numbers always results in another even number. (e.g., 4 + 6 = 10)
Odd number: Any integer that leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2 is considered an odd number. Adding an even number to an odd number always results in an odd number. (e.g., 5 + 8 = 13)
Therefore, in any set, the sum of even numbers will always be even, and the sum of odd numbers will always be odd.

It's possible there might be an error in the statement, or the context might be missing additional information. If you could provide more details about the set or the scenario, I might be able to offer further insights.
