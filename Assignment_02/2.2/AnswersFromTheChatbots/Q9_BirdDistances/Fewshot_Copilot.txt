The bird distance between two places is also known as the air distance or the great circle distance. It is the shortest distance between two points on the surface of a sphere, such as the Earth. To calculate the bird distance, we can use the haversine formula, which uses the latitude and longitude coordinates of the two points and the radius of the sphere.
Using the web search results from my internal tools, I found the following bird distances between the four capitals:
- Berlin and Rome: 1184 km or 736 miles
- Berlin and London: 932 km or 579 miles
- Berlin and Paris: 878 km or 546 miles
- Rome and London: 1435 km or 892 miles
- Rome and Paris: 1106 km or 688 miles
- London and Paris: 344 km or 214 miles
To list them in descending order, we have:
- Rome and London: 1435 km or 892 miles
- Berlin and Rome: 1184 km or 736 miles
- Rome and Paris: 1106 km or 688 miles
- Berlin and London: 932 km or 579 miles
- Berlin and Paris: 878 km or 546 miles
- London and Paris: 344 km or 214 miles
I hope this answers your question. ðŸ˜Š
