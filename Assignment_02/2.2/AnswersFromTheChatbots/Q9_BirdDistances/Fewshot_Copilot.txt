Certainly! Let's compare the bird distances (also known as great-circle distances) between the four European capitals: Berlin, Rome, London, and Paris. These distances represent the direct path between the cities, disregarding roads or other obstacles.
Here are the bird distances in descending order:
- Berlin to Rome: The straight-line distance between Berlin and Rome is approximately 1,183 kilometers (about 736 miles) .
- London to Rome: Unfortunately, I couldn't find the direct bird distance between London and Rome in my search results. However, I can tell you that it's greater than the Berlin-Rome distance.
- Paris to Rome: The great-circle distance between Paris and Rome is approximately 1,100 kilometers (about 684 miles) .
Please note that the actual road distances may differ due to geographical features and transportation routes. But when it comes to the crow's flight, these are the approximate distances. 🌍✈️.
