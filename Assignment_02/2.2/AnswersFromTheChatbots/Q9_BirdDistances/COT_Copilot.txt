Certainly! Let's break down the steps to compare the bird distances between the four capitals: Berlin, Rome, London, and Paris.
- Creating Combinations:
We'll generate all possible combinations of these four cities. Since we have four cities, there will be a total of 6 combinations:
    - Berlin - Rome
    - Berlin - London
    - Berlin - Paris
    - Rome - London
    - Rome - Paris
    - London - Paris
- Bird Distances:
For each combination, we'll calculate the bird distance (also known as the great-circle distance). This distance represents the shortest path between two points on the Earth's surface, assuming a spherical Earth.
- Descending Order:
Finally, we'll arrange these combinations in descending order based on their bird distances.
Let's proceed with the calculations:
- Berlin - Rome:
    - Bird Distance: Approximately 1,118 kilometers .
- Berlin - London:
    - Bird Distance: Approximately 1,050 kilometers .
- Berlin - Paris:
    - Bird Distance: Approximately 878 kilometers .
- Rome - London:
    - Bird Distance: Approximately 1,418 kilometers .
- Rome - Paris:
    - Bird Distance: Approximately 1,110 kilometers .
- London - Paris:
    - Bird Distance: Approximately 344 kilometers .
Now, let's arrange them in descending order:
- Rome - London: 1,418 km
- Berlin - Rome: 1,118 km
- Rome - Paris: 1,110 km
- Berlin - London: 1,050 km
- Berlin - Paris: 878 km
- London - Paris: 344 km
So, the combination with the longest bird distance is Rome - London, and the shortest is London - Paris. üåç‚úàÔ∏è
