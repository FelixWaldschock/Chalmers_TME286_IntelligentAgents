Let's break down the problem:
- You read 21 pages a day.
- You skip reading one day a week, so you read for 6 days a week.
- Therefore, in a week, you read $$21 \times 6 = 126$$ pages.
- The book has 630 pages.
So, to find out how many weeks it takes to finish the book, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages you read in a week:
$$\frac{630}{126} = 5$$
So, it will take you 5 weeks to finish the book if you maintain this reading schedule.
