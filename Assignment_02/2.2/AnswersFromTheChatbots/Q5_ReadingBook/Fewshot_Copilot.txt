Let's break this down step by step:
- Normal Reading Week:
    - If you read a single page every day, after one week, you read 7 pages.
- Missed Reading Week:
    - If you miss reading on a day, you only read 6 pages in that week.
Now, you read 21 pages a day and skip one day each week. Let's calculate how many pages you read in a week:
- Normal Reading Week: 21 pages/day Ã— 7 days/week = 147 pages/week
- Missed Reading Week: 21 pages/day Ã— 6 days/week = 126 pages/week
The difference between these two scenarios is 21 pages.
Given that the book consists of 630 pages, we need to find out how many weeks it takes to read the entire book.
- Total pages in the book: 630 pages
- Pages read per week (considering missed reading): 126 pages/week
Now, let's set up an equation:
[ \text{Total weeks} \times 126 \text{ pages/week} = 630 \text{ pages} ]
Solving for the total number of weeks:
[ \text{Total weeks} = \frac{630}{126} = 5 \text{ weeks} ]
Therefore, it will take you approximately 5 weeks to finish reading the entire book. Happy reading! ðŸ“šðŸŒŸ
