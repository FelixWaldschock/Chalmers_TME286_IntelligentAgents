When ones reads a single page every day, after one week 7 pages are read. If one misses to read on a day, this leads to only six pages being read after one week. 
A book consists of 630 pages. I read 21 pages a day. Every week I skip my reading session on one day. After how many weeks do I finish the book?




Skipping one day a week doesn't affect the total number of weeks needed to finish the book.

Here's why:

You read 21 pages a day, and there are 7 days in a week, so you read 21 pages/day * 7 days/week = 147 pages in a week without missing a day.
Since you skip one day every week, you read 147 pages/week - 21 pages/week (skipped day) = 126 pages every week.
Now, to find the number of weeks to finish the book, divide the total number of pages (630 pages) by the number of pages you read each week (126 pages/week):

630 pages / 126 pages/week = 5 weeks (approximately)

Therefore, it will take you approximately 5 weeks to finish the book, even though you skip one day of reading each week.
