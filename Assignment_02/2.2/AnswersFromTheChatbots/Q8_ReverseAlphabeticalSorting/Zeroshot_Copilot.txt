Sure, let's first reverse the spellings of the words:
- Apple -> elppA
- Pear -> raeP
- Banana -> ananaB
- Strawberry -> yrrebwartsS
Now, if we order these reversed words in alphabetical order, we get:
- ananaB (Banana)
- elppA (Apple)
- raeP (Pear)
- yrrebwartsS (Strawberry)
So, the original words ordered based on the reversed spellings are: Banana, Apple, Pear, Strawberry.
