The odd numbers in this set add up to an odd number: 10,15,12,13,21,17



You are correct. The statement "The odd numbers in this set add up to an odd number: 10, 15, 12, 13, 21, 17" is true.

Here's the breakdown:

The set contains numbers: 10, 15, 12, 13, 21, 17.
Among these, only 15, 13, 21, and 17 are odd numbers (all other numbers are even).
Adding these odd numbers, we get 15 + 13 + 21 + 17 = 66.
Since 66 is not divisible by 2, it is an odd number.
Therefore, the statement holds true as the sum of the odd numbers in the set is indeed an odd number.
