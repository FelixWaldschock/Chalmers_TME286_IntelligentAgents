To check if a number is even, on can check (number & 2 == 0). Where % is the modulo operator.

I want you to check if the odd numbers in this set add up to an odd number: 10,15,12,13,21,17?



You're right, the modulo operator (%) can be used to check for even and odd numbers. However, in the given list (10, 15, 12, 13, 21, 17), only 13, 15, 17, and 21 are odd numbers.

Even though 10 and 12 are not divisible by 2, they are not considered odd numbers in the mathematical definition. Odd numbers are defined as integers that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 2.

Therefore, among the odd numbers in the list, 13 + 15 + 17 + 21 = 66, which is an even number. So, the sum of the odd numbers in the set is not odd.
