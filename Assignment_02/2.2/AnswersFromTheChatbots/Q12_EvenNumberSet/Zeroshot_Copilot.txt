The given set of numbers is 10, 15, 12, 13, 21, 17. Let's find the median of this set.
- First, let's arrange the numbers in ascending order:
    - 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, 21
- Since there are 6 numbers in the set (which is an even count), we need to find the average of the middle two terms.
- The middle terms are 13 and 15.
- Calculating the average:
    - Median = (13 + 15) / 2 = 14
Therefore, the median of the given set is 14. ğŸŒŸ
