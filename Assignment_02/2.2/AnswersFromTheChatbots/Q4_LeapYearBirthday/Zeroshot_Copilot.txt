Eric was born on a leap day, which occurs every four years. Therefore, his third birthday would technically be on February 29, 2004. However, since February 29 doesn't occur every year, when it's not a leap year, the celebration would typically be on February 28 or March 1. In this case, Eric could have celebrated his third birthday on February 28 or March 1, 2004.
