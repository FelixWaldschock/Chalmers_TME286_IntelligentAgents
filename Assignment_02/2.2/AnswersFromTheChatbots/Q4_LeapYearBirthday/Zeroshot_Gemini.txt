Eric is born on the 29. of February 1996. When did Eric celebrate his third birthday?

Since February 1996 only has 29 days, February 29th doesn't exist in that year. Therefore, Eric wouldn't have been born on that specific date.

It's important to consider leap years, which happen every four years except for multiples of 100 but not multiples of 400. The year 1996 is a leap year, but February 29th still isn't a valid birthdate for Eric in that year.

If you have any other information about Eric's actual birthdate, I can help you calculate when he celebrated his third birthday.
