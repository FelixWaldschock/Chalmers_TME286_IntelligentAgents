Certainly! Let's determine if the sum of the odd numbers in the given set results in an odd number.
The set of numbers you provided is: 10, 15, 12, 13, 21, 17.
- First, let's identify the odd numbers from this set:
    - 15, 13, 21, and 17 are odd numbers.
- Now, let's calculate their sum:
    - Sum of odd numbers = 15 + 13 + 21 + 17 = 66.
- Finally, let's check if the sum is odd:
    - The sum of these odd numbers, 66, is indeed an even number.
Therefore, the sum of the odd numbers in the given set does not add up to an odd number. ğŸ¤”
