The even numbers in this set add up to an odd number: 10,15,12,13,21,17



It is not possible for the even numbers in a set to add up to an odd number. This is because:

Even numbers: Even numbers are integers that are divisible by 2, leaving no remainder. Examples: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, etc.
Adding even numbers: When you add two even numbers, the result is always another even number. This is because when you add two multiples of 2, the sum is also a multiple of 2.
Therefore, regardless of the specific even numbers you choose from the set (10, 15, 12, 13, 21, 17), their sum will always be even, and not odd.

It's possible there might be a mistake in the statement, or there might be additional information missing that would explain the seemingly contradictory situation.
