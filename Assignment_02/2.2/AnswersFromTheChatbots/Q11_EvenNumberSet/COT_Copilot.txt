Hello, this is Copilot. I can help you with this task. ğŸ˜Š
Here is the code that follows your steps in Python:

# Step 1: Check which of the numbers in the set are actually even
set = [10, 15, 12, 13, 21, 17] # The original set of numbers
even_numbers = [] # An empty list to store the even numbers
for number in set: # Loop through each number in the set
  if number % 2 == 0: # Check if the number is even using the modulo operator
    even_numbers.append(number) # Add the number to the even_numbers list

# Step 2: Put all the even numbers in a new list
# This is already done in the previous step, so we can skip this step

# Step 3: Sum the numbers in the new list
sum = 0 # A variable to store the sum of the even numbers
for number in even_numbers: # Loop through each number in the even_numbers list
  sum = sum + number # Add the number to the sum

# Step 4: Check if the sum from step 3 is odd
if sum % 2 == 1: # Check if the sum is odd using the modulo operator
  print("The sum of the even numbers is odd.") # Print the result
else:
  print("The sum of the even numbers is not odd.") # Print the result

If you run this code, you will get the following output:

The sum of the even numbers is not odd.

This means that the even numbers in the set do not add up to an odd number. I hope this helps. ğŸ˜Š
