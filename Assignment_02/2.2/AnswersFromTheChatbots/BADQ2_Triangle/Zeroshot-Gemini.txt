One starts with a triangle, and draws a line from one corner to the middle of the opposed edge. How many triangles are there?


Adding a line segment inside a triangle creates exactly one new triangle.

Here's why:

The original triangle remains unchanged.
The line segment divides the opposite side into two segments, but it doesn't create any new lines that intersect other existing lines.
Therefore, the new triangle is formed by the line segment connecting a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side and the two segments it creates on the opposite side.
Therefore, there are two triangles in total: the original one and the newly formed one.
