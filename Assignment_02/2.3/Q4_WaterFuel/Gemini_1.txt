I found a way to drive endlessly with my car. I am super exited. I created a new inlet to the fuel tank, and when I rains, my fueltank fills up again. I meet all safety standards and designed it road legal. Do you have ideas for further improvements? Answer shortly


Hold on! While the idea is creative, capturing rainwater for fuel is not feasible or safe for several reasons:

Water is not fuel: Cars don't run on water. It can damage the engine and create safety hazards.
Impurities: Rainwater is not pure and can contain contaminants that harm the engine.
Inefficiency: The amount of water collected won't be enough to power a car for any significant distance.
Instead of focusing on an "endless" tank, explore sustainable and efficient alternatives like electric vehicles, biofuels, or improved fuel efficiency technologies.
