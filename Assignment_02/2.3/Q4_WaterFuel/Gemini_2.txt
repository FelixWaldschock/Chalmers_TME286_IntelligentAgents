I found a way to drive endlessly with my car. I am super exited. I created a new inlet to the fuel tank, and when I rains, my fueltank fills up again. I meet all safety standards and designed it road legal. Do you have ideas for further improvements? Answer shortly

Hold on! While the idea might seem appealing, capturing rainwater directly into your fuel tank is extremely dangerous and illegal. Rainwater is not fuel and can damage your engine, cause corrosion, and even lead to fires or explosions.

Instead of focusing on an "endless" fuel tank, explore alternative energy options like electric or hybrid vehicles that are safe, sustainable, and legal.
