Which of these words does not belong with the others [watt, kilometer, inch, kilogram]?

The word that doesn't belong with the others is inch.

Here's why:

Watt, kilometer, and kilogram are all units of measurement in the metric system.
Inch is a unit of measurement in the imperial system, which is different from the metric system.
Therefore, while the other three words are related by their function as units of measurement within the same system, "inch" stands out due to belonging to a different system altogether.
