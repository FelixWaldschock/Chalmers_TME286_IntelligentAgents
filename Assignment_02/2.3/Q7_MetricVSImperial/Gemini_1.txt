Which of these words does not belong with the others [watt, kilometer, inch, kilogram]?




The word that doesn't belong with the others is inch.

Here's why:

Watt, kilometer, and kilogram are all units of measurement in the metric system.
Inch is a unit of measurement in the imperial system.
Therefore, inch stands out because it belongs to a different measurement system compared to the other three options.
