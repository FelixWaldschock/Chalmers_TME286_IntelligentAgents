The word that doesn’t belong with the others in this group is "inch"1. Let’s break it down:

Watt: A unit of power, typically used to measure electrical energy consumption or production.
Kilometer: A unit of length in the metric system, equivalent to 1000 meters.

Kilogram

Kilogram: A unit of mass, commonly used to measure weight or the amount of matter in an object.

Inch

Inch: A unit of length in the imperial and US customary systems, equal to one-twelfth of a foot.
The first three words (watt, kilometer, and kilogram) are all related to measurement—either power, length, or mass. However, “inch” stands out because it is not a unit of mass or power; it specifically measures length. Therefore, it doesn’t fit the same category as the others1.
