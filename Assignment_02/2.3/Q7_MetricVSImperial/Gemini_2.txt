Which of these words does not belong with the others [watt, kilometer, inch, kilogram]?
Show drafts









The word that doesn't belong with the others is inch.

Here's why:

Watt, kilometer, and kilogram are all units of measurement in the metric system.
Inch is a unit of measurement in the imperial system, which is not the same as the metric system.
Therefore, inch is the only word that doesn't belong with the others because it belongs to a different measurement system.
