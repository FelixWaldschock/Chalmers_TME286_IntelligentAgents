I want a hot dog.	What is a hot dog ?
What are they doing, dad?	I guess no one told them they were out of a job
As long as we are careful, we will make it.	How do you know that?
We are being pulled into it?	No. I do not think so...
What difference would that make?	Maybe not enough has gone wrong here.
No one was listening.	After a few years they discovered a problem.
But we need to take the box back to earth.	You do not need this only the idea.
Do you think he made it?	We are going to find out soon enough.
You really think we are the last humans alive anywhere? I don not know.
Is that what they call stealing these days? I did not know it belonged to anyone.
