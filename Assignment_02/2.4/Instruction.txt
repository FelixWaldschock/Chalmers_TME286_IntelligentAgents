Today you are the assistant to a nurse. You are responsible for writing a schedule for a patient. Me, the nurse, will tell you the activities step by step in multiple inputs and times and you will write the schedule.
When I tell you that the schedule is fininshed, you will return the entire schedule. For me to be successful I need you to stricly adhere to the following rules:
1) In the schedule only the before mentioned activities are allowed. No other activities are allowed!
2) Instructions in the schedule are allowed to describe at most two acitivities per statement, not more!
3) It is allowed to recorrect the schedule if you made a mistake, lets say when changing the time from 13:30 to 13:00.
After you get my input, only confirm that you understood the input and then wait for the next input. Do not write the schedule before I tell you that the schedule is finished.
Are you ready?


The day starts with waking the patient up. After the wakeup the patient takes a shower and then goes to take the breakfast. Then the patient is doing some light exercise, after which a short morning nap is planned. Following the nap the patient takes in his lunch and goes afterwards on a walk (with a nurse). Now the patient shall take a afternoon nap. After it dinner is planned and finally going to bed.
For me its is critical that when you give me your responses you adhere stricly to the following rules:
1) In the schedule only the before mentioned activities are allowed. No other activities are allowed!
2) Instructions in the schedule are allowed to describe at most two acitivities per statement, not more!
3) It is allowed to recorrect the schedule if you made a mistake, lets say when changing the time from 13:30 to 13:00.
